00:00:08,259 --> 00:00:08,269



3
00:00:08,269 --> 00:00:10,910
so good morning welcome back to the

4
00:00:10,910 --> 00:00:10,920



5
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:15,640
lecture today we will be dealing with

6
00:00:15,640 --> 00:00:15,650



7
00:00:15,650 --> 00:00:18,740
tangent vectors and it is indeed

8
00:00:18,740 --> 00:00:18,750



9
00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:21,010
one of the technical

10
00:00:21,010 --> 00:00:21,020



11
00:00:21,020 --> 00:00:24,050
key concepts in mechanics and

12
00:00:24,050 --> 00:00:24,060



13
00:00:24,060 --> 00:00:25,550
we will of course develop this based on

14
00:00:25,550 --> 00:00:25,560



15
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:27,650
the best of what we have done so far

16
00:00:27,650 --> 00:00:27,660



17
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:31,550
but the intuition is probably

18
00:00:31,550 --> 00:00:31,560



19
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:33,979
familiar to all of you imagine you are

20
00:00:33,979 --> 00:00:33,989



21
00:00:33,989 --> 00:00:36,080
moving you have a curve on

22
00:00:36,080 --> 00:00:36,090



23
00:00:36,090 --> 00:00:38,330
a manifold on a

24
00:00:38,330 --> 00:00:38,340



25
00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:41,209
differentiable manifold and

26
00:00:41,209 --> 00:00:41,219



27
00:00:41,219 --> 00:00:43,520
the intuition behind the tangent

28
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:43,530



29
00:00:43,530 --> 00:00:47,029
vector is probably that you are walking and

30
00:00:47,029 --> 00:00:47,039



31
00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:48,920
when at a certain point in time you

32
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:48,930



33
00:00:48,930 --> 00:00:51,049
are somewhere you can for

34
00:00:51,049 --> 00:00:51,059



35
00:00:51,059 --> 00:00:53,360
each specific point in time the

36
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:53,370



37
00:00:53,370 --> 00:00:55,729
tangent vector to this curve

38
00:00:55,729 --> 00:00:55,739



39
00:00:55,739 --> 00:00:58,069
look at or one would physically

40
00:00:58,069 --> 00:00:58,079



41
00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:00,739
also say

42
00:01:06,950 --> NaN:NaN:NaN,NaN



43
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:09,360
one would physically also say the

44
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:09,370



45
00:01:09,370 --> 00:01:12,540
velocity vector and it is actually

46
00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:12,550



47
00:01:12,550 --> 00:01:14,220
quite a nice picture and one

48
00:01:14,220 --> 00:01:14,230



49
00:01:14,230 --> 00:01:15,990
could now think well okay we embed

50
00:01:15,990 --> 00:01:16,000



51
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,850
this manifold in a higher

52
00:01:17,850 --> 00:01:17,860



53
00:01:17,860 --> 00:01:19,830
dimensional space so for example

54
00:01:19,830 --> 00:01:19,840



55
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:22,380
this two-dimensional manifold

56
00:01:22,380 --> 00:01:22,390



57
00:01:22,390 --> 00:01:23,910
here would be embedded in three-dimensional

58
00:01:23,910 --> 00:01:23,920



59
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:27,120
space and can then of course the

60
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:27,130



61
00:01:27,130 --> 00:01:30,030
vectors standing away in three-dimensional space

62
00:01:30,030 --> 00:01:30,040



63
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:33,710
understand wonderfully

64
00:01:33,710 --> 00:01:33,720



65
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:36,840
one can actually do it that way

66
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:36,850



67
00:01:36,850 --> 00:01:39,810
but we do it technically differently for

68
00:01:39,810 --> 00:01:39,820



69
00:01:39,820 --> 00:01:42,810
a technical reason but also for

70
00:01:42,810 --> 00:01:42,820



71
00:01:42,820 --> 00:01:46,230
a philosophical reason because imagine

72
00:01:46,230 --> 00:01:46,240



73
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:47,820
we want with this

74
00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:47,830



75
00:01:47,830 --> 00:01:49,850
manifold to describe the entire universe

76
00:01:49,850 --> 00:01:49,860



77
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:52,760
the entire spacetime even

78
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:52,770



79
00:01:52,770 --> 00:01:56,490
then it would be funny to have to

80
00:01:56,490 --> 00:01:56,500



81
00:01:56,500 --> 00:01:59,219
embed the entire universe in something even larger

82
00:01:59,219 --> 00:01:59,229



83
00:01:59,229 --> 00:02:01,650
and suddenly be able to talk about

84
00:02:01,650 --> 00:02:01,660



85
00:02:01,660 --> 00:02:03,990
velocity vectors of curves

86
00:02:03,990 --> 00:02:04,000



87
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:04,980
to be able to speak of

88
00:02:04,980 --> 00:02:04,990



89
00:02:04,990 --> 00:02:07,580
yes that would then lie outside of the

90
00:02:07,580 --> 00:02:07,590



91
00:02:07,590 --> 00:02:09,570
universe that is at least

92
00:02:09,570 --> 00:02:09,580



93
00:02:09,580 --> 00:02:11,759
philosophically not very nice

94
00:02:11,759 --> 00:02:11,769



95
00:02:11,769 --> 00:02:14,370
and one calls this in differential

96
00:02:14,370 --> 00:02:14,380



97
00:02:14,380 --> 00:02:17,250
geometry one would call this picture

98
00:02:17,250 --> 00:02:17,260



99
00:02:17,260 --> 00:02:20,340
an extrinsic definition or

100
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:20,350



101
00:02:20,350 --> 00:02:23,789
an extrinsic picture of a

102
00:02:23,789 --> 00:02:23,799



103
00:02:23,799 --> 00:02:27,150
tangent vector and what we

104
00:02:27,150 --> 00:02:27,160



105
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:29,240
want to do is an intrinsic

106
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:29,250



107
00:02:29,250 --> 00:02:32,130
definition in which the

108
00:02:32,130 --> 00:02:32,140



109
00:02:32,140 --> 00:02:35,370
velocity does not refer the

110
00:02:35,370 --> 00:02:35,380



111
00:02:35,380 --> 00:02:37,229
definition of the velocity vector

112
00:02:37,229 --> 00:02:37,239



113
00:02:37,239 --> 00:02:39,840
does not refer to the surrounding

114
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:39,850



115
00:02:39,850 --> 00:02:42,900
space and I claim that it is also the

116
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:42,910



117
00:02:42,910 --> 00:02:45,060
much more natural concept if you take

118
00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:45,070



119
00:02:45,070 --> 00:02:47,370
the new exercise sheet there is

120
00:02:47,370 --> 00:02:47,380



121
00:02:47,380 --> 00:02:51,539
a small picture in the upper right and there

122
00:02:51,539 --> 00:02:51,549



123
00:02:51,549 --> 00:02:53,310
it says underneath vector counter

124
00:02:53,310 --> 00:02:53,320



125
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:57,210
that is the speedy driver yes the

126
00:02:57,210 --> 00:02:57,220



127
00:02:57,220 --> 00:03:00,000
vector that is the driver and indeed

128
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:00,010



129
00:03:00,010 --> 00:03:01,949
your earliest childhood memories of

130
00:03:01,949 --> 00:03:01,959



131
00:03:01,959 --> 00:03:03,720
speed are certainly those

132
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:03,730



133
00:03:03,730 --> 00:03:07,020
in the car then you drive in the car and a

134
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:07,030



135
00:03:07,030 --> 00:03:08,789
car has at a certain

136
00:03:08,789 --> 00:03:08,799



137
00:03:08,799 --> 00:03:10,789
point in time a certain speed

138
00:03:10,789 --> 00:03:10,799



139
00:03:10,799 --> 00:03:13,920
okay and indeed speed

140
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:13,930



141
00:03:13,930 --> 00:03:16,080
or velocity vector is indeed

142
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:16,090



143
00:03:16,090 --> 00:03:18,450
a concept that we understand intuitively

144
00:03:18,450 --> 00:03:18,460



145
00:03:18,460 --> 00:03:20,970
and not one that we feel

146
00:03:20,970 --> 00:03:20,980



147
00:03:20,980 --> 00:03:23,640
needs to be defined via an embedding

148
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:23,650



149
00:03:23,650 --> 00:03:25,710
space so the intrinsic

150
00:03:25,710 --> 00:03:25,720



151
00:03:25,460 --> 00:03:28,120
as a child you experience as a child in the car

152
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:28,130



153
00:03:28,130 --> 00:03:35,020
the speed please per year that

154
00:03:35,020 --> 00:03:35,030



155
00:03:35,030 --> 00:03:40,330
is already advanced please yes that

156
00:03:40,330 --> 00:03:40,340



157
00:03:40,340 --> 00:03:42,240
is not advanced enough

158
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:42,250



159
00:03:42,250 --> 00:03:45,580
you look out the window or and there

160
00:03:45,580 --> 00:03:45,590



161
00:03:45,590 --> 00:03:48,070
you see the trees passing by and the like

162
00:03:48,070 --> 00:03:48,080



163
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:50,350
the posts on the side of the road right

164
00:03:50,350 --> 00:03:50,360



165
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:50,650
right

166
00:03:50,650 --> 00:03:50,660



167
00:03:50,660 --> 00:03:53,260
that means you look at your surroundings

168
00:03:53,260 --> 00:03:53,270



169
00:03:53,270 --> 00:03:55,540
and watch how everything flows

170
00:03:55,540 --> 00:03:55,550



171
00:03:55,550 --> 00:03:58,360
past you and you could of course

172
00:03:58,360 --> 00:03:58,370



173
00:03:58,370 --> 00:04:00,160
also instead of putting up some posts there

174
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:00,170



175
00:04:00,170 --> 00:04:01,930
you could also somehow

176
00:04:01,930 --> 00:04:01,940



177
00:04:01,940 --> 00:04:03,340
look there is a mountain range and you

178
00:04:03,340 --> 00:04:03,350



179
00:04:03,350 --> 00:04:05,350
drive past this mountain range and you

180
00:04:05,350 --> 00:04:05,360



181
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:06,550
notice it gets higher and then

182
00:04:06,550 --> 00:04:06,560



183
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:07,479
lower again as you look up through the window

184
00:04:07,479 --> 00:04:07,489



185
00:04:07,489 --> 00:04:08,740
and then hear how it

186
00:04:08,740 --> 00:04:08,750



187
00:04:08,750 --> 00:04:12,100
gets lower or if you now for example drive through

188
00:04:12,100 --> 00:04:12,110



189
00:04:12,110 --> 00:04:13,110
areas with large

190
00:04:13,110 --> 00:04:13,120



191
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:15,850
temperature fluctuations then you

192
00:04:15,850 --> 00:04:15,860



193
00:04:15,860 --> 00:04:17,530
notice or the temperature is hot

194
00:04:17,530 --> 00:04:17,540



195
00:04:17,540 --> 00:04:18,909
or no sense there it gets cold again

196
00:04:18,909 --> 00:04:18,919



197
00:04:18,919 --> 00:04:20,020
noticeably faster you drive so

198
00:04:20,020 --> 00:04:20,030



199
00:04:20,030 --> 00:04:21,880
faster it alternates

200
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:21,890



201
00:04:21,890 --> 00:04:23,890
that means when you drive along a curve

202
00:04:23,890 --> 00:04:23,900



203
00:04:23,900 --> 00:04:27,060
with your car and you observe

204
00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:27,070



205
00:04:27,070 --> 00:04:29,080
a surrounding let us say the

206
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:29,090



207
00:04:29,090 --> 00:04:31,030
function values in the surrounding

208
00:04:31,030 --> 00:04:31,040



209
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:33,010
temperatures mountain heights or such

210
00:04:33,010 --> 00:04:33,020



211
00:04:33,020 --> 00:04:34,770
something that is there and

212
00:04:34,770 --> 00:04:34,780



213
00:04:34,780 --> 00:04:37,810
look how they change while you

214
00:04:37,810 --> 00:04:37,820



215
00:04:37,820 --> 00:04:38,860
drive

216
00:04:38,860 --> 00:04:38,870



217
00:04:38,870 --> 00:04:41,170
the faster they change the

218
00:04:41,170 --> 00:04:41,180



219
00:04:41,180 --> 00:04:43,300
faster you are driving for given mountains

220
00:04:43,300 --> 00:04:43,310



221
00:04:43,310 --> 00:04:45,070
and given temperature distribution right

222
00:04:45,070 --> 00:04:45,080



223
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:47,560
and for trees and whatever else

224
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:47,570



225
00:04:47,570 --> 00:04:48,969
and exactly that is the intrinsic

226
00:04:48,969 --> 00:04:48,979



227
00:04:48,979 --> 00:04:50,770
description there you do not need any

228
00:04:50,770 --> 00:04:50,780



229
00:04:50,780 --> 00:04:52,390
surrounding space you only need

230
00:04:52,390 --> 00:04:52,400



231
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:54,310
on the manifold on which you

232
00:04:54,310 --> 00:04:54,320



233
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:58,180
drive reference functions okay that is

234
00:04:58,180 --> 00:04:58,190



235
00:04:58,190 --> 00:05:00,820
the intuition the extrinsic picture

236
00:05:00,820 --> 00:05:00,830



237
00:05:00,830 --> 00:05:03,060
what I just indicated is the

238
00:05:03,060 --> 00:05:03,070



239
00:05:03,070 --> 00:05:04,870
intrinsic picture and now we make

240
00:05:04,870 --> 00:05:04,880



241
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:09,190
all of this technical and first section

242
00:05:09,190 --> 00:05:09,200



243
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:12,700
smooth functions

244
00:05:15,290 --> NaN:NaN:NaN,NaN



245
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:23,930
and smooth curves so and this is

246
00:05:23,930 --> 00:05:23,940



247
00:05:23,940 --> 00:05:25,700
first of all a reminder of the

248
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:25,710



249
00:05:25,710 --> 00:05:28,460
last lecture

250
00:05:30,670 --> NaN:NaN:NaN,NaN



251
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:33,290
there we had taken something like a

252
00:05:33,290 --> 00:05:33,300



253
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:36,920
smooth manifold and what was that

254
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:36,930



255
00:05:36,930 --> 00:05:38,570
again a smooth manifold

256
00:05:38,570 --> 00:05:38,580



257
00:05:38,580 --> 00:05:40,249
that was in any case a set M

258
00:05:40,249 --> 00:05:40,259



259
00:05:40,259 --> 00:05:43,070
of points then you had a

260
00:05:43,070 --> 00:05:43,080



261
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:44,450
topology so that you at all

262
00:05:44,450 --> 00:05:44,460



263
00:05:44,460 --> 00:05:46,460
manifold becomes a topological

264
00:05:46,460 --> 00:05:46,470



265
00:05:46,470 --> 00:05:49,129
but then we also chose an atlas

266
00:05:49,129 --> 00:05:49,139



267
00:05:49,139 --> 00:05:51,529
and in this case a C
