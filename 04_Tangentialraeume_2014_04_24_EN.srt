00:00:08,259 --> 00:00:08,269



3
00:00:08,269 --> 00:00:10,910
so good morning welcome back to the

4
00:00:10,910 --> 00:00:10,920



5
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:15,640
lecture today we will be dealing with

6
00:00:15,640 --> 00:00:15,650



7
00:00:15,650 --> 00:00:18,740
tangent vectors and it is indeed

8
00:00:18,740 --> 00:00:18,750



9
00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:21,010
one of the technical

10
00:00:21,010 --> 00:00:21,020



11
00:00:21,020 --> 00:00:24,050
key concepts in mechanics and

12
00:00:24,050 --> 00:00:24,060



13
00:00:24,060 --> 00:00:25,550
we will of course develop this based on

14
00:00:25,550 --> 00:00:25,560



15
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:27,650
the best of what we have done so far

16
00:00:27,650 --> 00:00:27,660



17
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:31,550
but the intuition is probably

18
00:00:31,550 --> 00:00:31,560



19
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:33,979
familiar to all of you imagine you are

20
00:00:33,979 --> 00:00:33,989



21
00:00:33,989 --> 00:00:36,080
moving you have a curve on

22
00:00:36,080 --> 00:00:36,090



23
00:00:36,090 --> 00:00:38,330
a manifold on a

24
00:00:38,330 --> 00:00:38,340



25
00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:41,209
differentiable manifold and

26
00:00:41,209 --> 00:00:41,219



27
00:00:41,219 --> 00:00:43,520
the intuition behind the tangent

28
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:43,530



29
00:00:43,530 --> 00:00:47,029
vector is probably that you are walking and

30
00:00:47,029 --> 00:00:47,039



31
00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:48,920
when at a certain point in time you

32
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:48,930



33
00:00:48,930 --> 00:00:51,049
are somewhere you can for

34
00:00:51,049 --> 00:00:51,059



35
00:00:51,059 --> 00:00:53,360
each specific point in time the

36
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:53,370



37
00:00:53,370 --> 00:00:55,729
tangent vector to this curve

38
00:00:55,729 --> 00:00:55,739



39
00:00:55,739 --> 00:00:58,069
look at or one would physically

40
00:00:58,069 --> 00:00:58,079



41
00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:00,739
also say

42
00:01:06,950 --> NaN:NaN:NaN,NaN



43
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:09,360
one would physically also say the

44
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:09,370



45
00:01:09,370 --> 00:01:12,540
velocity vector and it is actually

46
00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:12,550



47
00:01:12,550 --> 00:01:14,220
quite a nice picture and one

48
00:01:14,220 --> 00:01:14,230



49
00:01:14,230 --> 00:01:15,990
could now think well okay we embed

50
00:01:15,990 --> 00:01:16,000



51
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,850
this manifold in a higher

52
00:01:17,850 --> 00:01:17,860



53
00:01:17,860 --> 00:01:19,830
dimensional space so for example

54
00:01:19,830 --> 00:01:19,840



55
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:22,380
this two-dimensional manifold

56
00:01:22,380 --> 00:01:22,390



57
00:01:22,390 --> 00:01:23,910
here would be embedded in three-dimensional

58
00:01:23,910 --> 00:01:23,920



59
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:27,120
space and can then of course the

60
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:27,130



61
00:01:27,130 --> 00:01:30,030
vectors standing away in three-dimensional space

62
00:01:30,030 --> 00:01:30,040



63
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:33,710
understand wonderfully

64
00:01:33,710 --> 00:01:33,720



65
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:36,840
one can actually do it that way

66
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:36,850



67
00:01:36,850 --> 00:01:39,810
but we do it technically differently for

68
00:01:39,810 --> 00:01:39,820



69
00:01:39,820 --> 00:01:42,810
a technical reason but also for

70
00:01:42,810 --> 00:01:42,820



71
00:01:42,820 --> 00:01:46,230
a philosophical reason because imagine

72
00:01:46,230 --> 00:01:46,240



73
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:47,820
we want with this

74
00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:47,830



75
00:01:47,830 --> 00:01:49,850
manifold to describe the entire universe

76
00:01:49,850 --> 00:01:49,860



77
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:52,760
the entire spacetime even

78
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:52,770



79
00:01:52,770 --> 00:01:56,490
then it would be funny to have to

80
00:01:56,490 --> 00:01:56,500



81
00:01:56,500 --> 00:01:59,219
embed the entire universe in something even larger

82
00:01:59,219 --> 00:01:59,229



83
00:01:59,229 --> 00:02:01,650
and suddenly be able to talk about

84
00:02:01,650 --> 00:02:01,660



85
00:02:01,660 --> 00:02:03,990
velocity vectors of curves

86
00:02:03,990 --> 00:02:04,000



87
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:04,980
to be able to speak of

88
00:02:04,980 --> 00:02:04,990



89
00:02:04,990 --> 00:02:07,580
yes that would then lie outside of the

90
00:02:07,580 --> 00:02:07,590



91
00:02:07,590 --> 00:02:09,570
universe that is at least

92
00:02:09,570 --> 00:02:09,580



93
00:02:09,580 --> 00:02:11,759
philosophically not very nice

94
00:02:11,759 --> 00:02:11,769



95
00:02:11,769 --> 00:02:14,370
and one calls this in differential

96
00:02:14,370 --> 00:02:14,380



97
00:02:14,380 --> 00:02:17,250
geometry one would call this picture

98
00:02:17,250 --> 00:02:17,260



99
00:02:17,260 --> 00:02:20,340
an extrinsic definition or

100
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:20,350



101
00:02:20,350 --> 00:02:23,789
an extrinsic picture of a

102
00:02:23,789 --> 00:02:23,799



103
00:02:23,799 --> 00:02:27,150
tangent vector and what we

104
00:02:27,150 --> 00:02:27,160



105
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:29,240
want to do is an intrinsic

106
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:29,250



107
00:02:29,250 --> 00:02:32,130
definition in which the

108
00:02:32,130 --> 00:02:32,140



109
00:02:32,140 --> 00:02:35,370
velocity does not refer the

110
00:02:35,370 --> 00:02:35,380



111
00:02:35,380 --> 00:02:37,229
definition of the velocity vector

112
00:02:37,229 --> 00:02:37,239



113
00:02:37,239 --> 00:02:39,840
does not refer to the surrounding

114
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:39,850



115
00:02:39,850 --> 00:02:42,900
space and I claim that it is also the

116
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:42,910



117
00:02:42,910 --> 00:02:45,060
much more natural concept if you take

118
00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:45,070



119
00:02:45,070 --> 00:02:47,370
the new exercise sheet there is

120
00:02:47,370 --> 00:02:47,380



121
00:02:47,380 --> 00:02:51,539
a small picture in the upper right and there

122
00:02:51,539 --> 00:02:51,549



123
00:02:51,549 --> 00:02:53,310
it says underneath vector counter

124
00:02:53,310 --> 00:02:53,320



125
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:57,210
that is the speedy driver yes the

126
00:02:57,210 --> 00:02:57,220



127
00:02:57,220 --> 00:03:00,000
vector that is the driver and indeed

128
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:00,010



129
00:03:00,010 --> 00:03:01,949
your earliest childhood memories of

130
00:03:01,949 --> 00:03:01,959



131
00:03:01,959 --> 00:03:03,720
speed are certainly those

132
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:03,730



133
00:03:03,730 --> 00:03:07,020
in the car then you drive in the car and a

134
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:07,030



135
00:03:07,030 --> 00:03:08,789
car has at a certain

136
00:03:08,789 --> 00:03:08,799



137
00:03:08,799 --> 00:03:10,789
point in time a certain speed

138
00:03:10,789 --> 00:03:10,799



139
00:03:10,799 --> 00:03:13,920
okay and indeed speed

140
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:13,930



141
00:03:13,930 --> 00:03:16,080
or velocity vector is indeed

142
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:16,090



143
00:03:16,090 --> 00:03:18,450
a concept that we understand intuitively

144
00:03:18,450 --> 00:03:18,460



145
00:03:18,460 --> 00:03:20,970
and not one that we feel

146
00:03:20,970 --> 00:03:20,980



147
00:03:20,980 --> 00:03:23,640
needs to be defined via an embedding

148
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:23,650



149
00:03:23,650 --> 00:03:25,710
space so the intrinsic

150
00:03:25,710 --> 00:03:25,720



151
00:03:25,460 --> 00:03:28,120
as a child you experience as a child in the car

152
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:28,130



153
00:03:28,130 --> 00:03:35,020
the speed please per year that

154
00:03:35,020 --> 00:03:35,030



155
00:03:35,030 --> 00:03:40,330
is already advanced please yes that

156
00:03:40,330 --> 00:03:40,340



157
00:03:40,340 --> 00:03:42,240
is not advanced enough

158
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:42,250



159
00:03:42,250 --> 00:03:45,580
you look out the window or and there

160
00:03:45,580 --> 00:03:45,590



161
00:03:45,590 --> 00:03:48,070
you see the trees passing by and the like

162
00:03:48,070 --> 00:03:48,080



163
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:50,350
the posts on the side of the road right

164
00:03:50,350 --> 00:03:50,360



165
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:50,650
right

166
00:03:50,650 --> 00:03:50,660



167
00:03:50,660 --> 00:03:53,260
that means you look at your surroundings

168
00:03:53,260 --> 00:03:53,270



169
00:03:53,270 --> 00:03:55,540
and watch how everything flows

170
00:03:55,540 --> 00:03:55,550



171
00:03:55,550 --> 00:03:58,360
past you and you could of course

172
00:03:58,360 --> 00:03:58,370



173
00:03:58,370 --> 00:04:00,160
also instead of putting up some posts there

174
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:00,170



175
00:04:00,170 --> 00:04:01,930
you could also somehow

176
00:04:01,930 --> 00:04:01,940



177
00:04:01,940 --> 00:04:03,340
look there is a mountain range and you

178
00:04:03,340 --> 00:04:03,350



179
00:04:03,350 --> 00:04:05,350
drive past this mountain range and you

180
00:04:05,350 --> 00:04:05,360



181
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:06,550
notice it gets higher and then

182
00:04:06,550 --> 00:04:06,560



183
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:07,479
lower again as you look up through the window

184
00:04:07,479 --> 00:04:07,489



185
00:04:07,489 --> 00:04:08,740
and then hear how it

186
00:04:08,740 --> 00:04:08,750



187
00:04:08,750 --> 00:04:12,100
gets lower or if you now for example drive through

188
00:04:12,100 --> 00:04:12,110



189
00:04:12,110 --> 00:04:13,110
areas with large

190
00:04:13,110 --> 00:04:13,120



191
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:15,850
temperature fluctuations then you

192
00:04:15,850 --> 00:04:15,860



193
00:04:15,860 --> 00:04:17,530
notice or the temperature is hot

194
00:04:17,530 --> 00:04:17,540



195
00:04:17,540 --> 00:04:18,909
or no sense there it gets cold again

196
00:04:18,909 --> 00:04:18,919



197
00:04:18,919 --> 00:04:20,020
noticeably faster you drive so

198
00:04:20,020 --> 00:04:20,030



199
00:04:20,030 --> 00:04:21,880
faster it alternates

200
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:21,890



201
00:04:21,890 --> 00:04:23,890
that means when you drive along a curve

202
00:04:23,890 --> 00:04:23,900



203
00:04:23,900 --> 00:04:27,060
with your car and you observe

204
00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:27,070



205
00:04:27,070 --> 00:04:29,080
a surrounding let us say the

206
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:29,090



207
00:04:29,090 --> 00:04:31,030
function values in the surrounding

208
00:04:31,030 --> 00:04:31,040



209
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:33,010
temperatures mountain heights or such

210
00:04:33,010 --> 00:04:33,020



211
00:04:33,020 --> 00:04:34,770
something that is there and

212
00:04:34,770 --> 00:04:34,780



213
00:04:34,780 --> 00:04:37,810
look how they change while you

214
00:04:37,810 --> 00:04:37,820



215
00:04:37,820 --> 00:04:38,860
drive

216
00:04:38,860 --> 00:04:38,870



217
00:04:38,870 --> 00:04:41,170
the faster they change the

218
00:04:41,170 --> 00:04:41,180



219
00:04:41,180 --> 00:04:43,300
faster you are driving for given mountains

220
00:04:43,300 --> 00:04:43,310



221
00:04:43,310 --> 00:04:45,070
and given temperature distribution right

222
00:04:45,070 --> 00:04:45,080



223
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:47,560
and for trees and whatever else

224
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:47,570



225
00:04:47,570 --> 00:04:48,969
and exactly that is the intrinsic

226
00:04:48,969 --> 00:04:48,979



227
00:04:48,979 --> 00:04:50,770
description there you do not need any

228
00:04:50,770 --> 00:04:50,780



229
00:04:50,780 --> 00:04:52,390
surrounding space you only need

230
00:04:52,390 --> 00:04:52,400



231
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:54,310
on the manifold on which you

232
00:04:54,310 --> 00:04:54,320



233
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:58,180
drive reference functions okay that is

234
00:04:58,180 --> 00:04:58,190



235
00:04:58,190 --> 00:05:00,820
the intuition the extrinsic picture

236
00:05:00,820 --> 00:05:00,830



237
00:05:00,830 --> 00:05:03,060
what I just indicated is the

238
00:05:03,060 --> 00:05:03,070



239
00:05:03,070 --> 00:05:04,870
intrinsic picture and now we make

240
00:05:04,870 --> 00:05:04,880



241
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:09,190
all of this technical and first section

242
00:05:09,190 --> 00:05:09,200



243
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:12,700
smooth functions

244
00:05:15,290 --> NaN:NaN:NaN,NaN



245
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:23,930
and smooth curves so and this is

246
00:05:23,930 --> 00:05:23,940



247
00:05:23,940 --> 00:05:25,700
first of all a reminder of the

248
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:25,710



249
00:05:25,710 --> 00:05:28,460
last lecture

250
00:05:30,670 --> NaN:NaN:NaN,NaN



251
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:33,290
there we had taken something like a

252
00:05:33,290 --> 00:05:33,300



253
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:36,920
smooth manifold and what was that

254
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:36,930



255
00:05:36,930 --> 00:05:38,570
again a smooth manifold

256
00:05:38,570 --> 00:05:38,580



257
00:05:38,580 --> 00:05:40,249
that was in any case a set M

258
00:05:40,249 --> 00:05:40,259



259
00:05:40,259 --> 00:05:43,070
of points then you had a

260
00:05:43,070 --> 00:05:43,080



261
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:44,450
topology so that you at all

262
00:05:44,450 --> 00:05:44,460



263
00:05:44,460 --> 00:05:46,460
manifold becomes a topological

264
00:05:46,460 --> 00:05:46,470



265
00:05:46,470 --> 00:05:49,129
but then we also chose an atlas

266
00:05:49,129 --> 00:05:49,139



267
00:05:49,139 --> 00:05:51,529
and in this case a C

268
00:05:51,529 --> 00:05:51,539



269
00:05:51,539 --> 00:05:53,689
infinity atlas then the

270
00:05:53,689 --> 00:05:53,699



271
00:05:53,699 --> 00:05:55,790
manifold is called smooth and you remember

272
00:05:55,790 --> 00:05:55,800



273
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:57,469
the C infinity atlas only has

274
00:05:57,469 --> 00:05:57,479



275
00:05:57,479 --> 00:05:59,480
charts such that when you consider the chart

276
00:05:59,480 --> 00:05:59,490



277
00:05:59,490 --> 00:06:01,760
transition functions they are

278
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:01,770



279
00:06:01,770 --> 00:06:04,459
as functions from R to the m into R

280
00:06:04,459 --> 00:06:04,469



281
00:06:04,469 --> 00:06:09,950
to the dm smooth arbitrarily often continuously

282
00:06:09,950 --> 00:06:09,960



283
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:11,689
differentiable and this smooth

284
00:06:11,689 --> 00:06:11,699



285
00:06:11,699 --> 00:06:13,700
manifold allows the

286
00:06:13,700 --> 00:06:13,710



287
00:06:13,710 --> 00:06:18,379
definition of smooth functions and since

288
00:06:18,379 --> 00:06:18,389



289
00:06:18,389 --> 00:06:21,820
we will need them again shortly

290
00:06:21,820 --> 00:06:21,830



291
00:06:21,830 --> 00:06:24,260
I will repeat them again we had

292
00:06:24,260 --> 00:06:24,270



293
00:06:24,270 --> 00:06:28,180
said that a function on the

294
00:06:28,180 --> 00:06:28,190



295
00:06:28,190 --> 00:06:33,319
manifold should be called smooth

296
00:06:33,909 --> NaN:NaN:NaN,NaN



297
00:06:33,919 --> 00:06:36,950
if yes and now we need the

298
00:06:36,950 --> 00:06:36,960



299
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:41,689
atlas if for every chart x that you

300
00:06:41,689 --> 00:06:41,699



301
00:06:41,699 --> 00:06:45,439
take from this atlas yes what was

302
00:06:45,439 --> 00:06:45,449



303
00:06:45,449 --> 00:06:46,939
again the condition for smoothness

304
00:06:46,939 --> 00:06:46,949



305
00:06:46,949 --> 00:06:49,279
expressed in the chart nobody can

306
00:06:49,279 --> 00:06:49,289



307
00:06:49,289 --> 00:06:51,469
remember that I cannot either

308
00:06:51,469 --> 00:06:51,479



309
00:06:51,479 --> 00:06:53,570
I always draw myself a picture so how

310
00:06:53,570 --> 00:06:53,580



311
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:55,129
is this we have a chart U that

312
00:06:55,129 --> 00:06:55,139



313
00:06:55,139 --> 00:06:56,089
lies in M

314
00:06:56,089 --> 00:06:56,099



315
00:06:56,099 --> 00:06:58,339
there I can certainly apply f

316
00:06:58,339 --> 00:06:58,349



317
00:06:58,349 --> 00:06:59,240
then it is however

318
00:06:59,240 --> 00:06:59,250



319
00:06:59,250 --> 00:07:01,249
restricted to that which does not hurt us at the moment

320
00:07:01,249 --> 00:07:01,259



321
00:07:01,259 --> 00:07:02,119
does not hurt

322
00:07:02,119 --> 00:07:02,129



323
00:07:02,129 --> 00:07:04,070
then I have here the chart mapping

324
00:07:04,070 --> 00:07:04,080



325
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:05,899
x goes to x of U

326
00:07:05,899 --> 00:07:05,909



327
00:07:05,909 --> 00:07:08,119
but that is a subset of R to the

328
00:07:08,119 --> 00:07:08,129



329
00:07:08,129 --> 00:07:10,309
d yes well the only thing I can

330
00:07:10,309 --> 00:07:10,319



331
00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:12,399
reasonably write here is f

332
00:07:12,399 --> 00:07:12,409



333
00:07:12,409 --> 00:07:15,980
to x inverse yes exactly that was

334
00:07:15,980 --> 00:07:15,990



335
00:07:15,990 --> 00:07:18,619
namely the representation of the function on

336
00:07:18,619 --> 00:07:18,629



337
00:07:18,629 --> 00:07:22,189
the chart instead of in the world world okay

338
00:07:22,189 --> 00:07:22,199



339
00:07:22,199 --> 00:07:24,620
and we wanted to call this C infinity

340
00:07:24,620 --> 00:07:24,630



341
00:07:24,630 --> 00:07:26,480
call it smooth if

342
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:26,490



343
00:07:26,490 --> 00:07:27,970
this here is smooth

344
00:07:27,970 --> 00:07:27,980



345
00:07:27,980 --> 00:07:29,560
down there we can decide that

346
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:29,570



347
00:07:29,570 --> 00:07:32,770
so if for every such chart

348
00:07:32,770 --> 00:07:32,780



349
00:07:32,780 --> 00:07:37,450
the mapping f x inverse which goes from

350
00:07:37,450 --> 00:07:37,460



351
00:07:37,460 --> 00:07:40,260
x of subset of R to the d

352
00:07:40,260 --> 00:07:40,270



353
00:07:40,270 --> 00:07:46,690
to R is smooth as a function

354
00:07:46,690 --> 00:07:46,700



355
00:07:46,700 --> 00:07:49,510
from R to the d into R

356
00:07:49,510 --> 00:07:49,520



357
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:51,220
and you can verify this with the simplest

358
00:07:51,220 --> 00:07:51,230



359
00:07:51,230 --> 00:07:53,530
analytical methods

360
00:07:53,530 --> 00:07:53,540



361
00:07:53,540 --> 00:07:55,180
you remember that was the definition

362
00:07:55,180 --> 00:07:55,190



363
00:07:55,190 --> 00:07:59,110
of smooth function what I

364
00:07:59,110 --> 00:07:59,120



365
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:00,640
had not shown you last time

366
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:00,650



367
00:08:00,650 --> 00:08:02,290
but had already pointed out

368
00:08:02,290 --> 00:08:02,300



369
00:08:02,300 --> 00:08:04,480
that it works exactly the same way is

370
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:04,490



371
00:08:04,490 --> 00:08:07,150
the definition of smooth curve so

372
00:08:07,150 --> 00:08:07,160



373
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:08,920
if you now take a curve gamma

374
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:08,930



375
00:08:08,930 --> 00:08:11,650
which first on a parameter

376
00:08:11,650 --> 00:08:11,660



377
00:08:11,660 --> 00:08:14,070
domain entirely in the manifold

378
00:08:14,070 --> 00:08:14,080



379
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:17,260
lands so here our yellow friend

380
00:08:17,260 --> 00:08:17,270



381
00:08:17,270 --> 00:08:19,600
then you can also call this curve smooth

382
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:19,610



383
00:08:19,610 --> 00:08:20,230
call it

384
00:08:20,230 --> 00:08:20,240



385
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:23,020
there is a new definition that was

386
00:08:23,020 --> 00:08:23,030



387
00:08:23,030 --> 00:08:27,940
only the recycled one is called smooth if well

388
00:08:27,940 --> 00:08:27,950



389
00:08:27,950 --> 00:08:29,500
we want to do this again quite similarly

390
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:29,510



391
00:08:29,510 --> 00:08:30,010
to do

392
00:08:30,010 --> 00:08:30,020



393
00:08:30,020 --> 00:08:32,770
we want to take a chart again

394
00:08:32,770 --> 00:08:32,780



395
00:08:32,780 --> 00:08:35,140
of course from our fancy

396
00:08:35,140 --> 00:08:35,150



397
00:08:35,150 --> 00:08:38,469
C infinity atlas and well this

398
00:08:38,469 --> 00:08:38,479



399
00:08:38,479 --> 00:08:39,969
diagram so that you do not

400
00:08:39,969 --> 00:08:39,979



401
00:08:39,979 --> 00:08:45,990
confuse it later just think of it

402
00:08:45,990 --> 00:08:46,000



403
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,070
and likewise if you want to understand

404
00:08:48,070 --> 00:08:48,080



405
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:50,710
this situation now then think

406
00:08:50,710 --> 00:08:50,720



407
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:52,540
about what it looks like now you

408
00:08:52,540 --> 00:08:52,550



409
00:08:52,550 --> 00:08:55,990
have here if you land in a chart here

410
00:08:55,990 --> 00:08:56,000



411
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,760
then you have you can of course

412
00:08:57,760 --> 00:08:57,770



413
00:08:57,770 --> 00:08:59,560
not take the entire parameter domain

414
00:08:59,560 --> 00:08:59,570



415
00:08:59,570 --> 00:09:02,920
because maybe this set

416
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:02,930



417
00:09:02,930 --> 00:09:04,660
that you select there

418
00:09:04,660 --> 00:09:04,670



419
00:09:04,670 --> 00:09:07,450
there the curve goes in and out and

420
00:09:07,450 --> 00:09:07,460



421
00:09:07,460 --> 00:09:09,640
in and out possibly there you can

422
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:09,650



423
00:09:09,650 --> 00:09:11,770
of course only when you restrict the curve with

424
00:09:11,770 --> 00:09:11,780



425
00:09:11,780 --> 00:09:14,020
this goal you can

426
00:09:14,020 --> 00:09:14,030



427
00:09:14,030 --> 00:09:17,530
of course only take the preimage of the curve of

428
00:09:17,530 --> 00:09:17,540



429
00:09:17,540 --> 00:09:19,960
this under the curve so these are

430
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:19,970



431
00:09:19,970 --> 00:09:21,550
exactly the parameters that lie

432
00:09:21,550 --> 00:09:21,560



433
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:23,710
in there then you have here again

434
00:09:23,710 --> 00:09:23,720



435
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:25,480
the chart mapping goes to x

436
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:25,490



437
00:05:49,490 --> 00:09:28,360
of are subset of the hoped for there we feel

438
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:28,370



439
00:09:28,370 --> 00:09:30,550
at home and here you can

440
00:09:30,550 --> 00:09:30,560



441
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:32,410
now make the successive executions

442
00:09:32,410 --> 00:09:32,420



443
00:09:32,420 --> 00:09:34,300
make now however nothing is after

444
00:09:34,300 --> 00:09:34,310



445
00:09:34,310 --> 00:09:36,820
down there and I only sign that

446
00:09:36,820 --> 00:09:36,830



447
00:09:36,830 --> 00:09:39,040
because mathematically speaking

448
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:39,050



449
00:09:39,050 --> 00:09:40,480
strictly speaking it is already a different

450
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:40,490



451
00:09:40,490 --> 00:09:41,620
curve because it has a different

452
00:09:41,620 --> 00:09:41,630



453
00:09:41,630 --> 00:09:43,630
domain of definition but it is

454
00:09:43,630 --> 00:09:43,640



455
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:45,570
of course defined there just like the

456
00:09:45,570 --> 00:09:45,580



457
00:09:45,580 --> 00:09:47,949
other curve so that is the situation

458
00:09:47,949 --> 00:09:47,959



459
00:09:47,959 --> 00:09:50,139
that we clarify for ourselves in the diagram again

460
00:09:50,139 --> 00:09:50,149



461
00:09:50,149 --> 00:09:53,050
it is also clear that would be

462
00:09:53,050 --> 00:09:53,060



463
00:09:53,060 --> 00:09:55,510
the chart representation of the curve was

464
00:09:55,510 --> 00:09:55,520



465
00:09:55,520 --> 00:09:58,000
that lands here in the chart that is

466
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:58,010



467
00:09:58,010 --> 00:10:00,160
that the course that the captain in the

468
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:00,170



469
00:10:00,170 --> 00:10:02,110
chart draws that is the course that the

470
00:10:02,110 --> 00:10:02,120



471
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:04,449
ship takes in the real world yes and

472
00:10:04,449 --> 00:10:04,459



473
00:10:04,459 --> 00:10:06,579
now we want to call this smooth

474
00:10:06,579 --> 00:10:06,589



475
00:10:06,589 --> 00:10:08,410
yes when where yes if this is smooth

476
00:10:08,410 --> 00:10:08,420



477
00:10:08,420 --> 00:10:13,300
if for all blah blah x following with

478
00:10:13,300 --> 00:10:13,310



479
00:10:13,310 --> 00:10:16,660
exactly this domain and target range

480
00:10:16,660 --> 00:10:16,670



481
00:10:16,670 --> 00:10:23,440
is smooth as a function as a mapping that

482
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:23,450



483
00:10:23,450 --> 00:10:26,110
now goes from R or a part of the first

484
00:10:26,110 --> 00:10:26,120



485
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:28,000
part of the hoped for goes and that we can

486
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:28,010



487
00:10:28,010 --> 00:10:30,639
decide again quite simply you

488
00:10:30,639 --> 00:10:30,649



489
00:10:30,649 --> 00:10:32,410
had function smooth mapping and so

490
00:10:32,410 --> 00:10:32,420



491
00:10:32,420 --> 00:10:33,480
on and so forth

492
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:33,490



493
00:10:33,490 --> 00:10:38,350
so now we have here smooth curves

494
00:10:38,350 --> 00:10:38,360



495
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:40,019
and smooth functions

496
00:10:40,019 --> 00:10:40,029



497
00:10:40,029 --> 00:10:42,430
you are perhaps from school physics

498
00:10:42,430 --> 00:10:42,440



499
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:45,449
accustomed to adding such curves

500
00:10:45,449 --> 00:10:45,459



501
00:10:45,459 --> 00:10:48,370
but it makes no sense at all can

502
00:10:48,370 --> 00:10:48,380



503
00:10:48,380 --> 00:10:50,440
I somehow take a curve gamma and a

504
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:50,450



505
00:10:50,450 --> 00:10:52,240
curve gamma tilde and

506
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:52,250



507
00:10:52,250 --> 00:10:53,139
add them

508
00:10:53,139 --> 00:10:53,149



509
00:10:53,149 --> 00:10:55,240
I would have to do that pointwise but

510
00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:55,250



511
00:10:55,250 --> 00:10:57,550
I have in the target range I have there

512
00:10:57,550 --> 00:10:57,560



513
00:10:57,560 --> 00:10:59,949
no addition it makes absolutely no

514
00:10:59,949 --> 00:10:59,959



515
00:10:59,959 --> 00:11:01,030
you see at all not the

516
00:11:01,030 --> 00:11:01,040



517
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:03,550
structure for that and so in such a real

518
00:11:03,550 --> 00:11:03,560



519
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:07,000
world what is Paris plus Rome supposed to

520
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:07,010



521
00:11:07,010 --> 00:11:08,710
be that does not exist Paris plus Rome

522
00:11:08,710 --> 00:11:08,720



523
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:11,590
makes no sense in the chart you could

524
00:11:11,590 --> 00:11:11,600



525
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:12,910
add you could say I

526
00:11:12,910 --> 00:11:12,920



527
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:14,740
define that as the sum of curves

528
00:11:14,740 --> 00:11:14,750



529
00:11:14,750 --> 00:11:17,260
in the chart there it turns out that

530
00:11:17,260 --> 00:11:17,270



531
00:11:17,270 --> 00:11:19,930
the result would not be chart independent

532
00:09:19,930 --> 00:11:19,940



533
00:11:19,940 --> 00:11:22,180
also not a bad idea it remains

534
00:11:22,180 --> 00:11:22,190



535
00:11:22,190 --> 00:11:24,569
so curves cannot be operated on

536
00:11:24,569 --> 00:11:24,579



537
00:11:24,579 --> 00:11:36,100
however remark differently than curves

538
00:11:38,030 --> NaN:NaN:NaN,NaN



539
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:46,110
one can functions and in particular

540
00:11:46,110 --> 00:11:46,120



541
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:50,780
of course smooth functions add and

542
00:11:50,780 --> 00:11:50,790



543
00:11:50,790 --> 00:11:53,790
scale

544
00:11:54,560 --> NaN:NaN:NaN,NaN



545
00:11:54,570 --> 00:11:57,630
I will explain this once and give it

546
00:11:57,630 --> 00:11:57,640



547
00:11:57,640 --> 00:12:00,180
a name pointwise addition and

548
00:12:00,180 --> 00:12:00,190



549
00:12:00,190 --> 00:12:02,820
scaling and in the future I will only say

550
00:12:02,820 --> 00:12:02,830



551
00:12:02,830 --> 00:12:04,920
pointwise addition or pointwise

552
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:04,930



553
00:12:04,930 --> 00:12:07,410
scaling is defined and then you have to

554
00:12:07,410 --> 00:12:07,420



555
00:12:07,420 --> 00:12:09,990
adapt that to the case where it occurs

556
00:12:09,990 --> 00:12:10,000



557
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,270
okay that saves me spit and is for you

558
00:12:12,270 --> 00:12:12,280



559
00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:15,660
good practice how does that work

560
00:12:15,660 --> 00:12:15,670



561
00:12:15,670 --> 00:12:19,260
so let us take a function let it

562
00:12:19,260 --> 00:12:19,270



563
00:12:19,270 --> 00:12:20,930
so be

564
00:12:20,930 --> 00:12:20,940



565
00:12:20,940 --> 00:12:25,830
f and g be functions on the

566
00:12:25,830 --> 00:12:25,840



567
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:27,720
entire manifold so mappings

568
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:27,730



569
00:12:27,730 --> 00:12:29,840
from M to R

570
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:29,850



571
00:12:29,850 --> 00:12:32,030
then we can define an operation

572
00:12:32,030 --> 00:12:32,040



573
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:34,050
which I will now call

574
00:12:34,050 --> 00:12:34,060



575
00:12:34,060 --> 00:12:36,480
circle plus later we drop the

576
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:36,490



577
00:12:36,490 --> 00:12:38,460
circle but that is too

578
00:12:38,460 --> 00:12:38,470



579
00:12:38,470 --> 00:12:41,610
premature for now so we write the circle

580
00:12:41,610 --> 00:12:41,620



581
00:12:41,620 --> 00:12:43,830
plus and what does this circle plus

582
00:12:43,830 --> 00:12:43,840



583
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:46,890
operation do it takes a function and

584
00:12:46,890 --> 00:12:46,900



585
00:12:46,900 --> 00:12:49,620
takes the types another function and

586
00:12:49,620 --> 00:12:49,630



587
00:12:49,630 --> 00:12:52,790
should make a function out of it again

588
00:12:52,790 --> 00:12:52,800



589
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:58,020
yes so this f plus plus g that should again

590
00:12:58,020 --> 00:12:58,030



591
00:12:58,030 --> 00:13:01,950
in its entirety that should

592
00:12:01,950 --> 00:13:01,960



593
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:05,280
be a function again yes how do we

594
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:05,290



595
00:13:05,290 --> 00:13:07,290
do this define it through

596
00:13:07,290 --> 00:13:07,300



597
00:13:07,300 --> 00:13:10,440
the following specification we say this

598
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:10,450



599
00:13:10,450 --> 00:13:12,450
new function it simply has the name

600
00:13:12,450 --> 00:13:12,460



601
00:13:12,460 --> 00:13:15,840
f circle plus go this new

602
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:15,850



603
00:13:15,850 --> 00:13:18,600
function shall be specified yes

604
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:18,610



605
00:13:18,610 --> 00:13:20,520
by what yes if I define something

606
00:13:20,520 --> 00:13:20,530



607
00:13:20,530 --> 00:13:22,110
I have to reflect back on

608
00:13:22,110 --> 00:13:22,120



609
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:25,110
what is known and what I could do

610
00:13:25,110 --> 00:13:25,120



611
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:27,990
I could evaluate the function f at point

612
00:13:27,990 --> 00:13:28,000



613
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:31,830
m and the function g at

614
00:13:31,830 --> 00:13:31,840



615
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:34,950
the point and then I could these two

616
00:13:34,950 --> 00:13:34,960



617
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:37,350
results where are they located f of m

618
00:13:37,350 --> 00:13:37,360



619
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:43,440
is where so I can there the known

620
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:43,450



621
00:13:43,450 --> 00:13:46,140
addition I will now give you still

622
00:13:46,140 --> 00:13:46,150



623
00:13:46,150 --> 00:13:48,580
here the nickname plus subscript R

624
00:13:48,580 --> 00:13:48,590



625
00:13:48,590 --> 00:13:51,520
I can use that and define

626
00:13:51,520 --> 00:13:51,530



627
00:13:51,530 --> 00:13:54,310
with it an addition between functions

628
00:13:54,310 --> 00:13:54,320



629
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:56,230
the addition between numbers is a

630
00:13:56,230 --> 00:13:56,240



631
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:57,970
number but the addition between two

632
00:13:57,970 --> 00:13:57,980



633
00:13:57,980 --> 00:14:00,730
functions is a function only when

634
00:14:00,730 --> 00:14:00,740



635
00:14:00,740 --> 00:14:02,190
I apply this function again to an

636
00:14:02,190 --> 00:14:02,200



637
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:04,960
element of the domain

638
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:04,970



639
00:14:04,970 --> 00:14:07,830
do I get a number again

640
00:14:07,830 --> 00:14:07,840



641
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:12,460
okay and such a definition here

642
00:14:12,460 --> 00:14:12,470



643
00:14:12,470 --> 00:14:14,350
one gives it a name that is so what

644
00:14:14,350 --> 00:14:14,360



645
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:16,110
it is called it is more of a kind of

646
00:14:16,110 --> 00:14:16,120



647
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:21,000
construction principle this construction

648
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:21,010



649
00:14:21,010 --> 00:14:29,680
this construction is called pointwise

650
00:14:30,000 --> NaN:NaN:NaN,NaN



651
00:14:30,010 --> 00:14:35,920
inheritance pointwise inheritance I know

652
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:35,930



653
00:14:35,930 --> 00:14:38,920
how to add on the target range and

654
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:38,930



655
00:14:38,930 --> 00:14:40,810
then I do it pointwise I

656
00:14:40,810 --> 00:14:40,820



657
00:14:40,820 --> 00:14:42,430
namely for every value on which I

658
00:14:42,430 --> 00:14:42,440



659
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:44,830
evaluate I do it so okay it is in any

660
00:14:44,830 --> 00:14:44,840



661
00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:46,600
case a possibility so that one

662
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:46,610



663
00:14:46,610 --> 00:14:47,620
does not always have to write it so extensively

664
00:14:47,620 --> 00:14:47,630



665
00:14:47,630 --> 00:14:49,210
one writes here

666
00:14:49,210 --> 00:14:49,220



667
00:14:49,220 --> 00:14:51,670
pointwise and now I can of course

668
00:14:51,670 --> 00:14:51,680



669
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:56,500
likewise do a scaling in that

670
00:14:56,500 --> 00:14:56,510



671
00:14:56,510 --> 00:14:57,880
case we are not now interested

672
00:14:57,880 --> 00:14:57,890



673
00:14:57,890 --> 00:14:59,890
in the product between two functions

674
00:14:59,890 --> 00:14:59,900



675
00:14:59,900 --> 00:15:04,210
but we are interested in a

676
00:15:04,210 --> 00:15:04,220



677
00:15:04,220 --> 00:15:06,340
scaling in which I give you a

678
00:15:06,340 --> 00:15:06,350



679
00:15:06,350 --> 00:15:10,380
real number and then I define

680
00:15:10,380 --> 00:15:10,390



681
00:15:10,390 --> 00:15:15,970
let us say a function and I define

682
00:15:15,970 --> 00:15:15,980



683
00:15:15,980 --> 00:15:18,760
that again pointwise by saying

684
00:15:18,760 --> 00:15:18,770



685
00:15:18,770 --> 00:15:22,030
that is alpha times f evaluated at the point

686
00:15:22,030 --> 00:15:22,040



687
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:24,010
and in between I can of course use this

688
00:15:24,010 --> 00:15:24,020



689
00:15:24,020 --> 00:15:25,320
inheritance

690
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:25,330



691
00:15:25,330 --> 00:15:29,680
okay yes it is all quite nice and so what

692
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:29,690



693
00:15:29,690 --> 00:15:31,180
is then of course again a

694
00:15:31,180 --> 00:15:31,190



695
00:15:31,190 --> 00:15:33,760
pointwise inheritance but in this case

696
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:33,770



697
00:15:33,770 --> 00:15:37,810
it is just the pointwise inheritance in

698
00:15:37,810 --> 00:15:37,820



699
00:15:37,820 --> 00:15:39,130
this case is just pointwise

700
00:15:39,130 --> 00:15:39,140



701
00:15:39,140 --> 00:15:43,870
inheritance of multiplication on that

702
00:15:43,870 --> 00:15:43,880



703
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:44,830
this may perhaps appear to you at

704
00:15:44,830 --> 00:15:44,840



705
00:15:44,840 --> 00:15:46,090
first glance a bit unnecessarily

706
00:15:46,090 --> 00:15:46,100



707
00:15:46,100 --> 00:15:48,400
abstract but this is very important also

708
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:48,410



709
00:15:48,410 --> 00:15:50,140
when you learn in school the sum

710
00:15:50,140 --> 00:15:50,150



711
00:15:50,150 --> 00:15:51,730
rule for derivatives

712
00:15:51,730 --> 00:15:51,740



713
00:15:51,740 --> 00:15:54,070
this refers to this plus you

714
00:15:54,070 --> 00:15:54,080



715
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:56,110
are namely differentiating functions not

716
00:15:56,110 --> 00:15:56,120



717
00:15:56,120 --> 00:15:58,480
function values you need to namely here

718
00:15:58,480 --> 00:15:58,490



719
00:15:58,490 --> 00:16:00,670
put the prime when you differentiate first

720
00:16:00,670 --> 00:16:00,680



721
00:16:00,680 --> 00:16:02,079
differentiate then evaluate

722
00:16:02,079 --> 00:16:02,089



723
00:16:02,089 --> 00:16:04,629
so the sum rule for derivatives

724
00:16:04,629 --> 00:16:04,639



725
00:16:04,639 --> 00:16:06,069
also refers here to this plus

726
00:16:06,069 --> 00:16:06,079



727
00:16:06,079 --> 00:16:07,600
well here we cannot so easily

728
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:07,610



729
00:16:07,610 --> 00:16:08,769
differentiate because of functions on the

730
00:16:08,769 --> 00:16:08,779



731
00:16:08,779 --> 00:16:10,059
manifold have we come to that

732
00:16:10,059 --> 00:16:10,069



733
00:16:10,069 --> 00:16:14,220
shortly so this definition stands so

734
00:16:14,220 --> 00:16:14,230



735
00:16:14,230 --> 00:16:19,839
and yes what do I want to say with this

736
00:16:29,320 --> NaN:NaN:NaN,NaN



737
00:16:29,330 --> 00:16:31,790
this is now such a typical case where

738
00:16:31,790 --> 00:16:31,800



739
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:35,900
one recognizes structure and I summarize that

740
00:16:35,900 --> 00:16:35,910



741
00:16:35,910 --> 00:16:40,400
now in a definition definition it

742
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:40,410



743
00:16:40,410 --> 00:16:46,960
denotes C infinity M

744
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:46,970



745
00:16:46,970 --> 00:16:50,420
the set and first of all only a

746
00:16:50,420 --> 00:16:50,430



747
00:16:50,430 --> 00:16:54,460
set C infinity M

748
00:16:54,460 --> 00:16:54,470



749
00:16:54,470 --> 00:16:57,920
that is the collection of all functions

750
00:16:57,920 --> 00:16:57,930



751
00:16:57,930 --> 00:16:59,330
on M

752
00:16:59,330 --> 00:16:59,340



753
00:16:59,340 --> 00:17:01,970
for which it holds that they are in our

754
00:17:01,970 --> 00:17:01,980



755
00:17:01,980 --> 00:17:05,000
defined sense smooth yes well that

756
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:05,010



757
00:17:05,010 --> 00:17:07,100
is simple C infinity is simply

758
00:17:07,100 --> 00:17:07,110



759
00:17:07,110 --> 00:17:09,830
the set of all smooth functions that

760
00:17:09,830 --> 00:17:09,840



761
00:17:09,840 --> 00:17:12,650
is however only a set and we

762
00:17:12,650 --> 00:17:12,660



763
00:17:12,660 --> 00:17:14,720
observe now or one would have to

764
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:14,730



765
00:17:14,730 --> 00:17:17,270
of course verify that if you take this

766
00:17:17,270 --> 00:17:17,280



767
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:20,540
set and you equip it with

768
00:17:20,540 --> 00:17:20,550



769
00:17:20,550 --> 00:17:22,820
the just defined pointwise

770
00:17:22,820 --> 00:17:22,830



771
00:17:22,830 --> 00:17:26,680
addition and scaling or

772
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:26,690



773
00:17:26,690 --> 00:17:30,200
multiplication then this

774
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:30,210



775
00:17:30,210 --> 00:17:38,780
structure fulfills the axioms and you would have

776
00:17:38,780 --> 00:17:38,790



777
00:17:38,790 --> 00:17:42,740
here is the commutative law

778
00:17:42,740 --> 00:17:42,750



779
00:17:42,750 --> 00:17:45,290
associative law law of neutral

780
00:17:45,290 --> 00:17:45,300



781
00:17:45,300 --> 00:17:47,690
element law of inverse element

782
00:17:47,690 --> 00:17:47,700



783
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:50,420
associative law distributive law another

784
00:17:50,420 --> 00:17:50,430



785
00:17:50,430 --> 00:17:52,400
distributive law and the

786
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:52,410



787
00:17:52,410 --> 00:17:54,530
unit law and of which

788
00:17:54,530 --> 00:17:54,540



789
00:17:54,540 --> 00:17:58,700
structure are these the axioms bravo exactly

790
00:17:58,700 --> 00:17:58,710



791
00:17:58,710 --> 00:18:02,110
the whole forms a vector space

792
00:18:02,110 --> 00:18:02,120



793
00:18:02,120 --> 00:18:05,330
that means the smooth functions in

794
00:18:05,330 --> 00:18:05,340



795
00:18:05,340 --> 00:18:07,070
their entirety with these

796
00:18:07,070 --> 00:18:07,080



797
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:09,550
operations form a vector space

798
00:18:09,550 --> 00:18:09,560



799
00:18:09,560 --> 00:18:11,960
are these already the vectors that we

800
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:11,970



801
00:18:11,970 --> 00:18:14,570
are looking for no these have nothing to do

802
00:18:14,570 --> 00:18:14,580



803
00:18:14,580 --> 00:18:16,850
with the vectors we want to construct

804
00:18:16,850 --> 00:18:16,860



805
00:18:16,860 --> 00:18:19,160
at all but we need them as

806
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:19,170



807
00:18:19,170 --> 00:18:21,650
tools to construct them okay so

808
00:18:21,650 --> 00:18:21,660



809
00:18:21,660 --> 00:18:23,570
now here do not let the concept vector

810
00:18:23,570 --> 00:18:23,580



811
00:18:23,580 --> 00:18:27,440
capture you too early

812
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:27,450



813
00:18:27,450 --> 00:18:31,940
please so end that was simply an

814
00:18:31,940 --> 00:18:31,950



815
00:18:31,950 --> 00:18:34,640
observation about these smooth

816
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:34,650



817
00:18:34,650 --> 00:18:38,570
functions which I can add

818
00:18:39,180 --> NaN:NaN:NaN,NaN



819
00:18:39,190 --> 00:18:45,210
next section tangent vectors

820
00:18:48,380 --> NaN:NaN:NaN,NaN



821
00:18:48,390 --> 00:18:50,160
now we come to the concrete

822
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:50,170



823
00:18:50,170 --> 00:18:54,870
definition and I will simply write it

824
00:18:54,870 --> 00:18:54,880



825
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:56,490
down and then we stare at it

826
00:18:56,490 --> 00:18:56,500



827
00:18:56,500 --> 00:19:00,540
together and then everything becomes clear

828
00:19:00,710 --> NaN:NaN:NaN,NaN



829
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:03,330
so now you would hear this is

830
00:19:03,330 --> 00:19:03,340



831
00:19:03,340 --> 00:19:05,340
really the central point here

832
00:19:05,340 --> 00:19:05,350



833
00:19:05,350 --> 00:19:09,240
we now consider a smooth

834
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:09,250



835
00:19:09,250 --> 00:19:16,890
curve let us say any smooth curve

836
00:19:16,890 --> 00:19:16,900



837
00:19:16,900 --> 00:19:27,270
gamma and where some chosen

838
00:19:27,270 --> 00:19:27,280



839
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:29,670
point p through which the curve runs so

840
00:19:29,670 --> 00:19:29,680



841
00:19:29,680 --> 00:19:32,340
I have here some parameter lambda

842
00:19:32,340 --> 00:19:32,350



843
00:19:32,350 --> 00:19:35,580
0 and to this parameter value lambda 0

844
00:19:35,580 --> 00:19:35,590



845
00:19:35,590 --> 00:19:38,300
there the curve should pass through point p

846
00:19:38,300 --> 00:19:38,310



847
00:19:38,310 --> 00:19:40,680
so let me draw a picture again

848
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:40,690



849
00:19:40,690 --> 00:19:45,540
manifold curve and the

850
00:19:45,540 --> 00:19:45,550



851
00:19:45,550 --> 00:19:48,210
curve does us the favor that it

852
00:19:48,210 --> 00:19:48,220



853
00:19:48,220 --> 00:19:50,490
passes through this point p and

854
00:19:50,490 --> 00:19:50,500



855
00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:52,740
it does so at a parameter whose value

856
00:19:52,740 --> 00:19:52,750



857
00:19:52,750 --> 00:19:54,150
lambda 0

858
00:19:54,150 --> 00:19:54,160



859
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:58,220
we consider such a smooth curve

860
00:19:58,220 --> 00:19:58,230



861
00:19:58,230 --> 00:20:05,250
definition then is called now I write

862
00:20:05,250 --> 00:20:05,260



863
00:20:05,260 --> 00:20:06,150
something down first

864
00:20:06,150 --> 00:20:06,160



865
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:10,320
the object is called capital and all our

866
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:10,330



867
00:20:10,330 --> 00:20:12,410
tangent vectors will always be called capital

868
00:20:12,410 --> 00:20:12,420



869
00:20:12,420 --> 00:20:15,990
X Y Z then capital is but

870
00:20:15,990 --> 00:20:16,000



871
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,910
that this is a special capital this is

872
00:20:17,910 --> 00:20:17,920



873
00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:19,890
namely a tangent vector to the

874
00:20:19,890 --> 00:20:19,900



875
00:19:19,900 --> 00:20:22,710
curve at point that the tangent

876
00:20:22,710 --> 00:20:22,720



877
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:25,650
vector to the curve gamma is we index

878
00:20:25,650 --> 00:20:25,660



879
00:20:25,660 --> 00:20:28,140
by saying of the

880
00:20:28,140 --> 00:20:28,150



881
00:20:28,150 --> 00:20:31,890
curve gamma and now we want

882
00:20:31,890 --> 00:20:31,900



883
00:20:31,900 --> 00:20:34,140
but not somewhere I could on this

884
00:20:34,140 --> 00:20:34,150



885
00:20:34,150 --> 00:20:35,730
curve at different places define a

886
00:20:35,730 --> 00:20:35,740



887
00:20:35,740 --> 00:20:37,890
tangent vector I want

888
00:20:37,890 --> 00:20:37,900



889
00:20:37,900 --> 00:20:40,230
it at the place small p I want

890
00:20:40,230 --> 00:20:40,240



891
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:41,910
now so a tangent vector

892
00:20:41,910 --> 00:20:41,920



893
00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:43,830
sorry I only said tangential away

894
00:20:43,830 --> 00:20:43,840



895
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:45,090
forgot again

896
00:20:45,090 --> 00:20:45,100



897
00:20:45,100 --> 00:20:46,860
I will call the thing differently in a moment

898
00:20:46,860 --> 00:20:46,870



899
00:20:46,870 --> 00:20:49,050
invest tangent vector I want this

900
00:20:49,050 --> 00:20:49,060



901
00:20:49,060 --> 00:20:50,250
object here to define

902
00:20:50,250 --> 00:20:50,260



903
00:20:50,260 --> 00:20:52,350
but I really should not have said tangential

904
00:20:52,350 --> 00:20:52,360



905
00:20:52,360 --> 00:20:53,730
away the whole lecture

906
00:20:53,730 --> 00:20:53,740



907
00:20:53,740 --> 00:20:55,760
is messed up

908
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:55,770



909
00:20:55,770 --> 00:21:00,350
so let us start all over again

910
00:21:00,350 --> 00:21:00,360



911
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:02,430
okay we consider only a curve and

912
00:21:02,430 --> 00:21:02,440



913
00:21:02,440 --> 00:21:04,590
now I define such an object there and

914
00:21:04,590 --> 00:21:04,600



915
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:05,760
now you will also see what

916
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:05,770



917
00:21:05,770 --> 00:21:07,710
kind of object this is it does namely

918
00:21:07,710 --> 00:21:07,720



919
00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:10,140
the following it takes namely an

920
00:21:10,140 --> 00:21:10,150



921
00:21:10,150 --> 00:21:13,170
arbitrary element from the vector space

922
00:21:13,170 --> 00:21:13,180



923
00:21:13,180 --> 00:21:16,530
of smooth functions okay with any

924
00:21:16,530 --> 00:21:16,540



925
00:21:16,540 --> 00:21:20,160
smooth function and this object maps

926
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:20,170



927
00:21:20,170 --> 00:21:23,760
any given smooth function on

928
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:23,770



929
00:21:23,770 --> 00:21:25,770
the manifold to only a real

930
00:21:25,770 --> 00:21:25,780



931
00:21:25,780 --> 00:21:29,790
number the way it does it is it does

932
00:21:29,790 --> 00:21:29,800



933
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:35,070
it as follows X subscript gamma P

934
00:21:35,070 --> 00:21:35,080



935
00:21:35,080 --> 00:21:37,290
my goal is the thing simply called think

936
00:21:37,290 --> 00:21:37,300



937
00:21:37,300 --> 00:21:38,310
nothing of it that is simply the

938
00:21:38,310 --> 00:21:38,320



939
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:40,200
nickname of the thing yes not subscript

940
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:40,210



941
00:21:40,210 --> 00:21:44,280
gamma is and in Japan it acts takes so

942
00:21:44,280 --> 00:21:44,290



943
00:21:44,290 --> 00:21:46,980
an element from here yes if I want to

944
00:21:46,980 --> 00:21:46,990



945
00:21:46,990 --> 00:21:48,450
define the mapping I have to say

946
00:21:48,450 --> 00:21:48,460



947
00:21:48,460 --> 00:21:51,180
how it does it and nothing simpler than

948
00:21:51,180 --> 00:21:51,190



949
00:21:51,190 --> 00:22:02,040
that this curve goes to M goes to

950
00:22:02,040 --> 00:22:02,050



951
00:22:02,050 --> 00:22:05,130
with f to R the curve lies here then

952
00:22:05,130 --> 00:22:05,140



953
00:22:05,140 --> 00:22:06,540
I can for example do something like that

954
00:22:06,540 --> 00:22:06,550



955
00:22:06,550 --> 00:22:08,220
when a function of the R yes the

956
00:22:08,220 --> 00:22:08,230



957
00:22:08,230 --> 00:22:11,070
I like it so again only the

958
00:22:11,070 --> 00:22:11,080



959
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:12,660
situation made clear that my

960
00:22:12,660 --> 00:22:12,670



961
00:22:12,670 --> 00:22:14,490
objects that I have what can I do

962
00:22:14,490 --> 00:22:14,500



963
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:17,160
there I can look at f composed with

964
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:17,170



965
00:22:17,170 --> 00:22:19,860
gamma and that is only a function from R to

966
00:22:19,860 --> 00:22:19,870



967
00:22:19,870 --> 00:22:20,580
R

968
00:22:20,580 --> 00:22:20,590



969
00:22:20,590 --> 00:22:23,580
that is not yet a real number but I

970
00:22:23,580 --> 00:22:23,590



971
00:22:23,590 --> 00:22:26,720
take this function and differentiate it

972
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:26,730



973
00:22:26,730 --> 00:22:29,550
with respect to what I can only differentiate with respect to the argument

974
00:22:29,550 --> 00:22:29,560



975
00:22:29,560 --> 00:22:32,820
here in front and evaluate the whole thing

976
00:22:32,820 --> 00:22:32,830



977
00:22:32,830 --> 00:22:37,200
at the parameter value lambda 0

978
00:22:38,000 --> NaN:NaN:NaN,NaN



979
00:22:38,010 --> 00:22:41,340
then this mapping is called then is called

980
00:22:41,340 --> 00:22:41,350



981
00:22:41,350 --> 00:22:44,820
the mapping what kind of

982
00:22:44,820 --> 00:22:44,830



983
00:22:44,830 --> 00:22:46,410
mapping is this what happens when

984
00:22:46,410 --> 00:22:46,420



985
00:22:46,420 --> 00:22:49,110
I take the sum here I take the

986
00:22:49,110 --> 00:22:49,120



987
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:54,120
sum of two functions f plus g what

988
00:22:54,120 --> 00:22:54,130



989
00:22:54,130 --> 00:22:58,140
would then be the result well that would be the

990
00:22:58,140 --> 00:22:58,150



991
00:22:58,150 --> 00:23:02,740
sum X of ps plus X of g

992
00:23:02,740 --> 00:23:02,750



993
00:23:02,750 --> 00:23:05,230
and if I would scale the f with

994
00:23:05,230 --> 00:23:05,240



995
00:23:05,240 --> 00:23:07,870
an alpha I would simply get that out

996
00:23:07,870 --> 00:23:07,880



997
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:10,830
that means this mapping is a

998
00:23:10,830 --> 00:23:10,840



999
00:23:10,840 --> 00:23:14,770
linear mapping when can I speak of

1000
00:23:14,770 --> 00:23:14,780



1001
00:23:14,780 --> 00:23:16,450
linear mapping

1002
00:23:16,450 --> 00:23:16,460



1003
00:23:16,460 --> 00:23:19,090
between two vector spaces I cannot

1004
00:23:19,090 --> 00:23:19,100



1005
00:23:19,100 --> 00:23:20,710
simply say independent linear

1006
00:23:20,710 --> 00:23:20,720



1007
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:22,240
so that I can say the mapping is

1008
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:22,250



1009
00:23:22,250 --> 00:23:23,110
linear

1010
00:23:23,110 --> 00:23:23,120



1011
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:24,580
you know only the addition and

1012
00:23:24,580 --> 00:23:24,590



1013
00:23:24,590 --> 00:23:27,430
scaling must both the domain

1014
00:23:27,430 --> 00:23:27,440



1015
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:29,230
and the target range be a

1016
00:23:29,230 --> 00:23:29,240



1017
00:23:29,240 --> 00:23:31,180
vector space be given now here then

1018
00:23:31,180 --> 00:23:31,190



1019
00:23:31,190 --> 00:23:33,430
the linear mapping X subscript gamma

1020
00:23:33,430 --> 00:23:33,440



1021
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:36,070
this function maps to a real

1022
00:23:36,070 --> 00:23:36,080



1023
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:39,400
number and so defined this is called

1024
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:39,410



1025
00:23:39,410 --> 00:23:42,370
that means the mapping directional

1026
00:23:42,370 --> 00:23:42,380



1027
00:23:42,380 --> 00:23:52,810
derivative directional derivative along

1028
00:23:52,810 --> 00:23:52,820



1029
00:23:52,820 --> 00:23:58,600
gamma along gamma that is the curve at

1030
00:23:58,600 --> 00:23:58,610



1031
00:23:58,610 --> 00:24:05,140
point p okay that's what this thing is called

1032
00:24:05,140 --> 00:24:05,150



1033
00:24:05,150 --> 00:24:07,120
and of course this is of course

1034
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:07,130



1035
00:24:07,130 --> 00:24:09,730
a derivative it acts on things there

1036
00:24:09,730 --> 00:24:09,740



1037
00:24:09,740 --> 00:24:10,990
one could for example check the product

1038
00:24:10,990 --> 00:24:11,000



1039
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:12,460
rule or perhaps

1040
00:24:12,460 --> 00:24:12,470



1041
00:24:12,470 --> 00:24:14,530
apply it to f times g I can also

1042
00:24:14,530 --> 00:24:14,540



1043
00:24:14,540 --> 00:24:18,520
define before we now go on to look at

1044
00:24:18,520 --> 00:24:18,530



1045
00:24:18,530 --> 00:24:20,350
the formal properties

1046
00:24:20,350 --> 00:24:20,360



1047
00:24:20,360 --> 00:24:22,030
let's first build some intuition

1048
00:24:22,030 --> 00:24:22,040



1049
00:24:22,040 --> 00:24:25,450
I claim this is what you as

1050
00:24:25,450 --> 00:24:25,460



1051
00:24:25,460 --> 00:24:28,030
children saw what you as a child

1052
00:24:28,030 --> 00:24:28,040



1053
00:24:28,040 --> 00:24:30,400
perceived as velocity

1054
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:30,410



1055
00:24:30,410 --> 00:24:32,920
before school shaped you they had

1056
00:24:32,920 --> 00:24:32,930



1057
00:24:32,930 --> 00:24:34,480
drilled into you velocity as vector

1058
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:34,490



1059
00:24:34,490 --> 00:24:37,260
component collections

1060
00:24:37,260 --> 00:24:37,270



1061
00:24:37,270 --> 00:24:39,580
but this is what you as children

1062
00:24:39,580 --> 00:24:39,590



1063
00:24:39,590 --> 00:24:41,530
perceived what did you do you

1064
00:24:41,530 --> 00:24:41,540



1065
00:24:41,540 --> 00:24:43,720
got into the car and drove along

1066
00:24:43,720 --> 00:24:43,730



1067
00:24:43,730 --> 00:24:46,360
in the car with dad or mom somewhere

1068
00:24:46,360 --> 00:24:46,370



1069
00:24:46,370 --> 00:24:49,780
along and outside there was something

1070
00:24:49,780 --> 00:24:49,790



1071
00:24:49,790 --> 00:24:52,060
by the roadside trees that kept

1072
00:24:52,060 --> 00:24:52,070



1073
00:24:52,070 --> 00:24:53,740
changing height you have to

1074
00:24:53,740 --> 00:24:53,750



1075
00:24:53,750 --> 00:24:55,270
distinguish the trees somehow

1076
00:24:55,270 --> 00:24:55,280



1077
00:24:55,280 --> 00:24:57,340
they are given by the function

1078
00:24:57,340 --> 00:24:57,350



1079
00:24:57,350 --> 00:24:59,380
this is here that the tree is so that the

1080
00:24:59,380 --> 00:24:59,390



1081
00:24:59,390 --> 00:25:01,510
tree is this tall and so on you drive

1082
00:25:01,510 --> 00:25:01,520



1083
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:03,280
through the forest with lots of

1084
00:25:03,280 --> 00:25:03,290



1085
00:25:03,290 --> 00:25:04,540
differently tall trees

1086
00:25:04,540 --> 00:25:04,550



1087
00:25:04,550 --> 00:25:06,310
that certainly takes work you can also

1088
00:25:06,310 --> 00:25:06,320



1089
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:07,750
take another forest you can take

1090
00:25:07,750 --> 00:25:07,760



1091
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:11,470
any forest yes and you drive

1092
00:25:11,470 --> 00:25:11,480



1093
00:25:11,480 --> 00:25:13,810
through the forest but you don't look at how

1094
00:25:13,810 --> 00:25:13,820



1095
00:25:13,820 --> 00:25:15,460
the trees back there change you

1096
00:25:15,460 --> 00:25:15,470



1097
00:25:15,470 --> 00:25:16,150
only look at how

1098
00:25:16,150 --> 00:25:16,160



1099
00:25:16,160 --> 00:25:18,010
trees where you are right now how they

1100
00:25:18,010 --> 00:25:18,020



1101
00:25:18,020 --> 00:25:19,450
change and you walk through a

1102
00:25:19,450 --> 00:25:19,460



1103
00:25:19,460 --> 00:25:20,020
cave

1104
00:25:20,020 --> 00:25:20,030



1105
00:25:20,030 --> 00:25:22,720
yes and then you walk through and look

1106
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:22,730



1107
00:25:22,730 --> 00:25:25,360
always above you always above

1108
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:25,370



1109
00:25:25,370 --> 00:25:28,270
your movement path this is this

1110
00:25:28,270 --> 00:25:28,280



1111
00:25:28,280 --> 00:25:30,460
composition you look at what

1112
00:25:30,460 --> 00:25:30,470



1113
00:25:30,470 --> 00:25:32,770
the values of the surroundings are of the function

1114
00:25:32,770 --> 00:25:32,780



1115
00:25:32,780 --> 00:25:35,590
but only along your curve and then

1116
00:25:35,590 --> 00:25:35,600



1117
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:37,300
you look the trees are five

1118
00:25:37,300 --> 00:25:37,310



1119
00:25:37,310 --> 00:25:40,330
meters tall two meters tall two and a half four

1120
00:25:40,330 --> 00:25:40,340



1121
00:25:40,340 --> 00:25:42,100
and you ask yourself when I walk along

1122
00:25:42,100 --> 00:25:42,110



1123
00:25:42,110 --> 00:25:44,530
like this how does the height of the trees change

1124
00:25:44,530 --> 00:25:44,540



1125
00:25:44,540 --> 00:25:45,610
that I see there

1126
00:25:45,610 --> 00:25:45,620



1127
00:25:45,620 --> 00:25:48,130
and if you walk the same path

1128
00:25:48,130 --> 00:25:48,140



1129
00:25:48,140 --> 00:25:49,540
but go through faster that is

1130
00:25:49,540 --> 00:25:49,550



1131
00:25:49,550 --> 00:25:51,190
actually a different curve but let's say

1132
00:25:51,190 --> 00:25:51,200



1133
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:52,570
the same path but faster

1134
00:25:52,570 --> 00:25:52,580



1135
00:25:52,580 --> 00:25:54,190
then it will also change faster

1136
00:25:54,190 --> 00:25:54,200



1137
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:55,540
and now you are at some

1138
00:25:55,540 --> 00:25:55,550



1139
00:25:55,550 --> 00:25:58,000
parameter value lambda zero David your alarm rings

1140
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:58,010



1141
00:25:58,010 --> 00:25:59,800
you check what is right now

1142
00:25:59,800 --> 00:25:59,810



1143
00:25:59,810 --> 00:26:02,380
the rate of change of tree height

1144
00:26:02,380 --> 00:26:02,390



1145
00:26:02,390 --> 00:26:03,780
where I am

1146
00:26:03,780 --> 00:26:03,790



1147
00:26:03,790 --> 00:26:05,770
of course you don't look above you

1148
00:26:05,770 --> 00:26:05,780



1149
00:26:05,780 --> 00:26:07,150
and out the window but you

1150
00:26:07,150 --> 00:26:07,160



1151
00:26:07,160 --> 00:26:09,610
understand already so and this is what

1152
00:26:09,610 --> 00:26:09,620



1153
00:26:09,620 --> 00:26:12,400
a this is the directional derivative of

1154
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:12,410



1155
00:26:12,410 --> 00:26:13,960
when you walk in the direction you are

1156
00:26:13,960 --> 00:26:13,970



1157
00:26:13,970 --> 00:26:15,280
yes something different than when you from the same

1158
00:26:15,280 --> 00:26:15,290



1159
00:26:15,290 --> 00:26:16,630
point walk in a different direction

1160
00:26:16,630 --> 00:26:16,640



1161
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:21,340
would yes and this encodes this idea of

1162
00:26:21,340 --> 00:26:21,350



1163
00:26:21,350 --> 00:26:23,860
directional derivative along a curve

1164
00:26:23,860 --> 00:26:23,870



1165
00:26:23,870 --> 00:26:25,920
at a point p

1166
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:25,930



1167
00:26:25,930 --> 00:26:28,870
so as I said before we now

1168
00:26:28,870 --> 00:26:28,880



1169
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:31,630
deal with these formal properties of

1170
00:26:31,630 --> 00:26:31,640



1171
00:26:31,640 --> 00:26:34,210
this object I would like to

1172
00:26:34,210 --> 00:26:34,220



1173
00:26:34,220 --> 00:26:42,940
yes okay make the following remark

1174
00:26:55,180 --> NaN:NaN:NaN,NaN



1175
00:26:55,190 --> 00:26:56,230
and it is again such a

1176
00:26:56,230 --> 00:26:56,240



1177
00:26:56,240 --> 00:27:00,460
terminological remark there is nothing

1178
00:27:00,460 --> 00:27:00,470



1179
00:27:00,470 --> 00:27:03,160
in it but you need to know it

1180
00:27:03,160 --> 00:27:03,170



1181
00:27:03,170 --> 00:27:11,980
terminology one calls X subscript p

1182
00:27:12,420 --> NaN:NaN:NaN,NaN



1183
00:27:12,430 --> 00:27:15,310
so this mapping one calls this

1184
00:27:15,310 --> 00:27:15,320



1185
00:27:15,320 --> 00:27:22,710
mapping X subscript gamma also the

1186
00:27:22,710 --> 00:27:22,720



1187
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:27,100
tangent vector the tangent

1188
00:27:27,100 --> 00:27:27,110



1189
00:27:27,110 --> 00:27:36,130
vector to the curve gamma at point p I

1190
00:27:36,130 --> 00:27:36,140



1191
00:27:36,140 --> 00:27:39,040
emphasize at the traversed point you

1192
00:27:39,040 --> 00:27:39,050



1193
00:27:39,050 --> 00:27:40,530
can of course do more

1194
00:27:40,530 --> 00:27:40,540



1195
00:27:40,540 --> 00:27:42,640
with a point that the curve also

1196
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:42,650



1197
00:27:42,650 --> 00:27:47,140
passes through at the traversed point p and

1198
00:27:47,140 --> 00:27:47,150



1199
00:27:47,150 --> 00:27:49,810
this is the full name of this object

1200
00:27:49,810 --> 00:27:49,820



1201
00:27:49,820 --> 00:27:54,130
and when you think vector think always

1202
00:27:54,130 --> 00:27:54,140



1203
00:27:54,140 --> 00:27:56,260
arrow but from now on with

1204
00:27:56,260 --> 00:27:56,270



1205
00:27:56,270 --> 00:27:57,850
vector you must never again think arrows

1206
00:27:57,850 --> 00:27:57,860



1207
00:27:57,860 --> 00:27:59,830
you must always think mapping

1208
00:27:59,830 --> 00:27:59,840



1209
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:02,650
what we call a tangent vector

1210
00:28:02,650 --> 00:28:02,660



1211
00:28:02,660 --> 00:28:05,170
is a mapping what kind of

1212
00:28:05,170 --> 00:28:05,180



1213
00:28:05,180 --> 00:28:07,720
mapping this mapping what is the

1214
00:28:07,720 --> 00:28:07,730



1215
00:28:07,730 --> 00:28:10,360
meaning it is logically seen the

1216
00:28:10,360 --> 00:28:10,370



1217
00:28:10,370 --> 00:28:14,920
directional derivative yes so the directional

1218
00:28:14,920 --> 00:28:14,930



1219
00:28:14,930 --> 00:28:16,750
derivative is called tangent vector but

1220
00:28:16,750 --> 00:28:16,760



1221
00:28:16,760 --> 00:28:18,580
so a tangent vector is exactly

1222
00:28:18,580 --> 00:28:18,590



1223
00:28:18,590 --> 00:28:21,240
that is simply a directional derivative

1224
00:28:21,240 --> 00:28:21,250



1225
00:28:21,250 --> 00:28:23,890
one can formulate it in many ways

1226
00:28:23,890 --> 00:28:23,900



1227
00:28:23,900 --> 00:28:27,250
that are all okay one could also

1228
00:28:27,250 --> 00:28:27,260



1229
00:28:27,260 --> 00:28:29,260
say in the differential geometry that

1230
00:28:29,260 --> 00:28:29,270



1231
00:28:29,270 --> 00:28:32,620
we practice the concept of a

1232
00:28:32,620 --> 00:28:32,630



1233
00:28:32,630 --> 00:28:36,040
vector survives in the form of a directional

1234
00:28:36,040 --> 00:28:36,050



1235
00:28:36,050 --> 00:28:38,770
derivative perhaps you have so far

1236
00:28:38,770 --> 00:28:38,780



1237
00:28:38,780 --> 00:28:40,300
always seen it this way there is derivative

1238
00:28:40,300 --> 00:28:40,310



1239
00:28:40,310 --> 00:28:42,070
in space and there you can somehow

1240
00:28:42,070 --> 00:28:42,080



1241
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:44,110
throw in a direction there you

1242
00:28:44,110 --> 00:28:44,120



1243
00:28:44,120 --> 00:28:45,400
have derivative have directions

1244
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:45,410



1245
00:28:45,410 --> 00:28:46,990
the total concept is directional

1246
00:28:46,990 --> 00:28:47,000



1247
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:49,540
derivative but actually reversed the

1248
00:28:49,540 --> 00:28:49,550



1249
00:28:49,550 --> 00:28:51,310
directional derivative is the elementary

1250
00:28:51,310 --> 00:28:51,320



1251
00:28:51,320 --> 00:28:53,650
concept and the direction is quasi only

1252
00:28:53,650 --> 00:28:53,660



1253
00:28:53,660 --> 00:28:56,290
philosophy that belongs to it but this is

1254
00:28:56,290 --> 00:28:56,300



1255
00:28:56,300 --> 00:28:58,060
the definition okay this is the

1256
00:28:58,060 --> 00:28:58,070



1257
00:28:58,070 --> 00:29:00,610
tangent vector and if you want

1258
00:29:00,610 --> 00:29:00,620



1259
00:29:00,620 --> 00:29:04,210
examples for this then please look

1260
00:29:04,210 --> 00:29:04,220



1261
00:29:04,220 --> 00:29:07,350
at exercise 1 of the new problem sheet

1262
00:29:07,350 --> 00:29:07,360



1263
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:09,850
examples see

1264
00:29:09,850 --> 00:29:09,860



1265
00:29:09,860 --> 00:29:17,390
exercise 1 fourth problem sheet

1266
00:29:25,600 --> NaN:NaN:NaN,NaN



1267
00:29:25,610 --> 00:29:28,720
so we will now ask ourselves you

1268
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:28,730



1269
00:29:28,730 --> 00:29:30,610
naturally yes wait a moment that can't

1270
00:29:30,610 --> 00:29:30,620



1271
00:29:30,620 --> 00:29:32,350
have been completely wrong with the

1272
00:29:32,350 --> 00:29:32,360



1273
00:29:32,360 --> 00:29:34,780
velocity components where do

1274
00:29:34,780 --> 00:29:34,790



1275
00:29:34,790 --> 00:29:36,340
the velocity components come from

1276
00:29:36,340 --> 00:29:36,350



1277
00:29:36,350 --> 00:29:37,539
now that one encountered in school or in the

1278
00:29:37,539 --> 00:29:37,549



1279
00:29:37,549 --> 00:29:39,310
experimental physics lecture

1280
00:29:39,310 --> 00:29:39,320



1281
00:29:39,320 --> 00:29:42,190
answer for that you must choose a

1282
00:29:42,190 --> 00:29:42,200



1283
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:43,780
chart

1284
00:29:43,780 --> 00:29:43,790



1285
00:29:43,790 --> 00:29:46,180
you have not used any chart at all

1286
00:29:46,180 --> 00:29:46,190



1287
00:29:46,190 --> 00:29:48,130
this is a completely in the real world

1288
00:29:48,130 --> 00:29:48,140



1289
00:29:48,140 --> 00:29:50,500
existing definition on the at the

1290
00:29:50,500 --> 00:29:50,510



1291
00:29:50,510 --> 00:29:52,750
level if you choose a chart

1292
00:29:52,750 --> 00:29:52,760



1293
00:29:52,760 --> 00:29:55,390
you can then in the chart determine components

1294
00:29:55,390 --> 00:29:55,400



1295
00:29:55,400 --> 00:29:57,310
but those then depend on the

1296
00:29:57,310 --> 00:29:57,320



1297
00:29:57,320 --> 00:29:59,740
chart we will do that later

1298
00:29:59,740 --> 00:29:59,750



1299
00:29:59,750 --> 00:30:02,020
before we get there I will now

1300
00:30:02,020 --> 00:30:02,030



1301
00:30:02,030 --> 00:30:04,539
first introduce a central concept

1302
00:30:04,539 --> 00:30:04,549



1303
00:30:04,549 --> 00:30:08,789
namely the concept of tangent spaces

1304
00:30:08,789 --> 00:30:08,799



1305
00:30:08,799 --> 00:30:17,080
thirdly tangent spaces and it is

1306
00:30:17,080 --> 00:30:17,090



1307
00:30:17,090 --> 00:30:23,620
again very simple definition the set

1308
00:30:23,620 --> 00:30:23,630



1309
00:30:23,630 --> 00:30:26,320
first again just a set the

1310
00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:26,330



1311
00:30:26,330 --> 00:30:30,460
set with the name T subscript p M is called

1312
00:30:30,460 --> 00:30:30,470



1313
00:30:30,470 --> 00:30:33,880
just so the tangent space to the

1314
00:30:33,880 --> 00:30:33,890



1315
00:30:33,890 --> 00:30:37,570
manifold M at point p okay what

1316
00:30:37,570 --> 00:30:37,580



1317
00:30:37,580 --> 00:30:38,560
should that be

1318
00:30:38,560 --> 00:30:38,570



1319
00:30:38,570 --> 00:30:41,950
as a set this is the collection of all

1320
00:30:41,950 --> 00:30:41,960



1321
00:30:41,960 --> 00:30:45,850
tangent vectors at the point where

1322
00:30:45,850 --> 00:30:45,860



1323
00:30:45,860 --> 00:30:49,630
gamma is any so that means an

1324
00:30:49,630 --> 00:30:49,640



1325
00:30:49,640 --> 00:30:52,210
arbitrary or all any smooth

1326
00:30:52,210 --> 00:30:52,220



1327
00:30:52,220 --> 00:30:58,030
curve through p is

1328
00:30:59,869 --> NaN:NaN:NaN,NaN



1329
00:30:59,879 --> 00:31:01,399
good one can draw a very nice picture of this

1330
00:31:01,399 --> 00:31:01,409



1331
00:31:01,409 --> 00:31:05,149
so the picture from the beginning this

1332
00:31:05,149 --> 00:31:05,159



1333
00:31:05,159 --> 00:31:06,680
morning there is somehow what I there so

1334
00:31:06,680 --> 00:31:06,690



1335
00:31:06,690 --> 00:31:09,559
part of a sphere so and now you want

1336
00:31:09,559 --> 00:31:09,569



1337
00:31:09,569 --> 00:31:12,949
the tangent space let's say at

1338
00:31:12,949 --> 00:31:12,959



1339
00:31:12,959 --> 00:31:14,930
this point to have

1340
00:31:14,930 --> 00:31:14,940



1341
00:31:14,940 --> 00:31:18,619
what is the tangent space good as

1342
00:31:18,619 --> 00:31:18,629



1343
00:31:18,629 --> 00:31:21,709
a set again how constructed are we

1344
00:31:21,709 --> 00:31:21,719



1345
00:31:21,719 --> 00:31:23,899
must through this point first

1346
00:31:23,899 --> 00:31:23,909



1347
00:31:23,909 --> 00:31:26,239
consider some curve gamma and

1348
00:31:26,239 --> 00:31:26,249



1349
00:31:26,249 --> 00:31:27,619
after that another curve still another

1350
00:31:27,619 --> 00:31:27,629



1351
00:31:27,629 --> 00:31:30,979
another that is a curve gamma and this

1352
00:31:30,979 --> 00:31:30,989



1353
00:31:30,989 --> 00:31:33,859
curve gamma now I am so tempted

1354
00:31:33,859 --> 00:31:33,869



1355
00:31:33,869 --> 00:31:35,389
here this vector this tangent

1356
00:31:35,389 --> 00:31:35,399



1357
00:31:35,399 --> 00:31:37,909
vector arrow to draw but I will

1358
00:31:37,909 --> 00:31:37,919



1359
00:31:37,919 --> 00:31:40,339
not do it

1360
00:31:41,259 --> NaN:NaN:NaN,NaN



1361
00:31:41,269 --> 00:31:43,009
now there is here another

1362
00:31:43,009 --> 00:31:43,019



1363
00:31:43,019 --> 00:31:44,779
curve that also runs through this point

1364
00:31:44,779 --> 00:31:44,789



1365
00:31:44,789 --> 00:31:47,479
let's take this curve here also a

1366
00:31:47,479 --> 00:31:47,489



1367
00:31:47,489 --> 00:31:49,129
curve gamma that also runs through this

1368
00:31:49,129 --> 00:31:49,139



1369
00:31:49,139 --> 00:31:50,899
point and I think if I once

1370
00:31:50,899 --> 00:31:50,909



1371
00:31:50,909 --> 00:31:53,539
more then everyone has understood as you

1372
00:31:53,539 --> 00:31:53,549



1373
00:31:53,549 --> 00:31:55,699
consider every curve gamma through this

1374
00:31:55,699 --> 00:31:55,709



1375
00:31:55,709 --> 00:31:58,519
point so also the curve gamma here

1376
00:31:58,519 --> 00:31:58,529



1377
00:31:58,529 --> 00:32:00,199
that now runs in the direction that

1378
00:32:00,199 --> 00:32:00,209



1379
00:32:00,209 --> 00:32:01,399
runs in the direction

1380
00:32:01,399 --> 00:32:01,409



1381
00:32:01,409 --> 00:32:03,919
that runs in the direction runs in the

1382
00:32:03,919 --> 00:32:03,929



1383
00:32:03,929 --> 00:32:06,319
direction you consider all possible

1384
00:32:06,319 --> 00:32:06,329



1385
00:32:06,329 --> 00:32:09,889
curves through the point you consider

1386
00:32:09,889 --> 00:32:09,899



1387
00:32:09,899 --> 00:32:11,299
however also if I already this

1388
00:32:11,299 --> 00:32:11,309



1389
00:32:11,309 --> 00:32:13,099
yellow curve have painted

1390
00:32:13,099 --> 00:32:13,109



1391
00:32:13,109 --> 00:32:15,019
you naturally consider with every

1392
00:32:15,019 --> 00:32:15,029



1393
00:32:15,029 --> 00:32:16,819
possible curve I naturally also mean

1394
00:32:16,819 --> 00:32:16,829



1395
00:32:16,829 --> 00:32:19,459
curves that though here the blue

1396
00:32:19,459 --> 00:32:19,469



1397
00:32:19,469 --> 00:32:22,669
runs exactly the same path as the

1398
00:32:22,669 --> 00:32:22,679



1399
00:32:22,679 --> 00:32:25,329
yellow one but twice as fast

1400
00:32:25,329 --> 00:32:25,339



1401
00:32:25,339 --> 00:32:28,399
okay you can drive exactly the same path

1402
00:32:28,399 --> 00:32:28,409



1403
00:32:28,409 --> 00:32:30,919
but twice as fast that is the

1404
00:32:30,919 --> 00:32:30,929



1405
00:32:30,929 --> 00:32:34,009
foundation of the German auto industry

1406
00:32:35,289 --> NaN:NaN:NaN,NaN



1407
00:32:35,299 --> 00:32:37,849
if we now really talk about

1408
00:32:37,849 --> 00:32:37,859



1409
00:32:37,859 --> 00:32:39,889
velocity that if I

1410
00:32:39,889 --> 00:32:39,899



1411
00:32:39,899 --> 00:32:42,109
now would draw these vectors the

1412
00:32:42,109 --> 00:32:42,119



1413
00:32:42,119 --> 00:32:44,149
tangent vector don't do but don't

1414
00:32:44,149 --> 00:32:44,159



1415
00:32:44,159 --> 00:32:46,609
because the vector is not an arrow at all

1416
00:32:46,609 --> 00:32:46,619



1417
00:32:46,619 --> 00:32:48,829
but if I were to draw here then

1418
00:32:48,829 --> 00:32:48,839



1419
00:32:48,839 --> 00:32:50,869
the arrow of the velocity

1420
00:32:50,869 --> 00:32:50,879



1421
00:32:50,879 --> 00:32:53,239
vector of the yellow curve would be only

1422
00:32:53,239 --> 00:32:53,249



1423
00:32:53,249 --> 00:32:55,159
half as long at this point as the

1424
00:32:55,159 --> 00:32:55,169



1425
00:32:55,169 --> 00:32:57,879
velocity vector of the blue curve

1426
00:32:57,879 --> 00:32:57,889



1427
00:32:57,889 --> 00:33:00,949
okay if you now imagine that you

1428
00:32:00,949 --> 00:33:00,959



1429
00:33:00,959 --> 00:33:03,139
pass through a point here with

1430
00:33:03,139 --> 00:33:03,149



1431
00:33:03,149 --> 00:33:05,899
all curves but each curve also with

1432
00:33:05,899 --> 00:33:05,909



1433
00:33:05,909 --> 00:33:08,569
every velocity then you get

1434
00:33:08,569 --> 00:33:08,579



1435
00:33:08,579 --> 00:33:11,659
in total all tangent vectors at

1436
00:33:11,659 --> 00:33:11,669



1437
00:33:11,669 --> 00:33:13,400
the point and if

1438
00:33:13,400 --> 00:33:13,410



1439
00:33:13,410 --> 00:33:16,280
now I would draw them as arrows which I

1440
00:33:16,280 --> 00:33:16,290



1441
00:33:16,290 --> 00:33:17,780
cannot do because it is not an arrow

1442
00:33:17,780 --> 00:33:17,790



1443
00:33:17,790 --> 00:33:20,300
it is a mapping but if I

1444
00:33:20,300 --> 00:33:20,310



1445
00:33:20,310 --> 00:33:23,150
would draw them as arrows then you would get

1446
00:33:23,150 --> 00:33:23,160



1447
00:33:23,160 --> 00:33:26,060
as endpoint of these arrows the entire

1448
00:33:26,060 --> 00:33:26,070



1449
00:33:26,070 --> 00:33:29,990
tangent plane to this object can

1450
00:33:29,990 --> 00:33:30,000



1451
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:30,890
you imagine that

1452
00:33:30,890 --> 00:33:30,900



1453
00:33:30,900 --> 00:33:32,900
the longer vectors in one direction

1454
00:33:32,900 --> 00:33:32,910



1455
00:33:32,910 --> 00:33:34,460
you get by

1456
00:33:34,460 --> 00:33:34,470



1457
00:33:34,470 --> 00:33:37,070
running through the curves faster and in

1458
00:33:37,070 --> 00:33:37,080



1459
00:33:37,080 --> 00:33:38,240
other directions you get vectors

1460
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:38,250



1461
00:33:38,250 --> 00:33:40,810
by choosing other curves that's clear

1462
00:33:40,810 --> 00:33:40,820



1463
00:33:40,820 --> 00:33:44,210
so and I draw as I said I also know

1464
00:33:44,210 --> 00:33:44,220



1465
00:33:44,220 --> 00:33:45,590
that we are quite tempted now the

1466
00:33:45,590 --> 00:33:45,600



1467
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:47,330
arrows to draw but we don't draw them

1468
00:33:47,330 --> 00:33:47,340



1469
00:33:47,340 --> 00:33:49,430
because it is not this

1470
00:33:49,430 --> 00:33:49,440



1471
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:51,920
extrinsic picture it is this

1472
00:33:51,920 --> 00:33:51,930



1473
00:33:51,930 --> 00:33:54,020
intrinsic we don't need any reference

1474
00:33:54,020 --> 00:33:54,030



1475
00:33:54,030 --> 00:33:56,840
to the surrounding space and the

1476
00:33:56,840 --> 00:33:56,850



1477
00:33:56,850 --> 00:34:00,020
price we pay for the

1478
00:34:00,020 --> 00:34:00,030



1479
00:34:00,030 --> 00:34:02,120
surrounding space not needing to reference

1480
00:34:02,120 --> 00:34:02,130



1481
00:34:02,130 --> 00:34:04,340
is that we no longer talk about

1482
00:34:04,340 --> 00:34:04,350



1483
00:34:04,350 --> 00:34:07,160
vector arrows but understand the vector

1484
00:34:07,160 --> 00:34:07,170



1485
00:34:07,170 --> 00:34:09,020
or the directions as

1486
00:34:09,020 --> 00:34:09,030



1487
00:34:09,030 --> 00:34:12,440
directional derivatives okay I could

1488
00:34:12,440 --> 00:34:12,450



1489
00:34:12,450 --> 00:34:14,030
now so each element in here


1490
00:34:14,030 --> 00:34:14,040



1491
00:34:14,040 --> 00:34:16,220
take and on any function

1492
00:34:16,220 --> 00:34:16,230



1493
00:34:16,230 --> 00:34:18,440
that is defined on here for you

1494
00:34:18,440 --> 00:34:18,450



1495
00:34:18,450 --> 00:34:20,090
again a temperature distribution or so

1496
00:34:20,090 --> 00:34:20,100



1497
00:34:20,100 --> 00:34:23,210
let it act and then it would just

1498
00:34:23,210 --> 00:34:23,220



1499
00:34:23,220 --> 00:34:24,820
act in this form here

1500
00:34:24,820 --> 00:34:24,830



1501
00:34:24,830 --> 00:34:28,010
okay but on every temperature distribution

1502
00:34:28,010 --> 00:34:28,020



1503
00:34:28,020 --> 00:34:29,870
not on a specific one on every one would

1504
00:34:29,870 --> 00:34:29,880



1505
00:34:29,880 --> 00:34:31,909
it act and that defines thereby

1506
00:34:31,909 --> 00:34:31,919



1507
00:34:31,919 --> 00:34:35,840
the mapping we will make more

1508
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:35,850



1509
00:34:35,850 --> 00:34:38,750
remarks about this shortly so now

1510
00:34:38,750 --> 00:34:38,760



1511
00:34:38,760 --> 00:34:40,400
I already have again so suspicious

1512
00:34:40,400 --> 00:34:40,410



1513
00:34:40,410 --> 00:34:43,669
quite questions so far

1514
00:34:54,760 --> NaN:NaN:NaN,NaN



1515
00:34:54,770 --> 00:34:56,840
please that you think three-dimensionally

1516
00:34:56,840 --> 00:34:56,850



1517
00:34:56,850 --> 00:34:59,270
and not

1518
00:35:12,819 --> NaN:NaN:NaN,NaN



1519
00:35:12,829 --> 00:35:15,470
you put a tangent with the infinite

1520
00:35:15,470 --> 00:35:15,480



1521
00:35:15,480 --> 00:35:17,000
velocity is such a thing

1522
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:17,010



1523
00:35:17,010 --> 00:35:20,710
because then somehow here

1524
00:35:20,710 --> 00:35:20,720



1525
00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:22,670
infinity would come out

1526
00:35:22,670 --> 00:35:22,680



1527
00:35:22,680 --> 00:35:24,319
and there was not only continuous

1528
00:35:24,319 --> 00:35:24,329



1529
00:35:24,329 --> 00:35:25,910
differentiated but with great

1530
00:35:25,910 --> 00:35:25,920



1531
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:28,160
velocity

1532
00:35:29,319 --> NaN:NaN:NaN,NaN



1533
00:35:29,329 --> 00:35:39,079
pardon what the sphere think you don't

1534
00:35:39,079 --> 00:35:39,089



1535
00:35:39,089 --> 00:35:41,870
so if I now ask you abstractly

1536
00:35:41,870 --> 00:35:41,880



1537
00:35:41,880 --> 00:35:43,099
at this point in space because it

1538
00:35:43,099 --> 00:35:43,109



1539
00:35:43,109 --> 00:35:44,920
is my fingertip which

1540
00:35:44,920 --> 00:35:44,930



1541
00:35:44,930 --> 00:35:47,240
velocities are there that means

1542
00:35:47,240 --> 00:35:47,250



1543
00:35:47,250 --> 00:35:48,559
someone once velocity is a

1544
00:35:48,559 --> 00:35:48,569



1545
00:35:48,569 --> 00:35:50,030
property of a curve right

1546
00:35:50,030 --> 00:35:50,040



1547
00:35:50,040 --> 00:35:52,400
and yes it is all the velocities

1548
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:52,410



1549
00:35:52,410 --> 00:35:54,200
that you can realize through curves through this point

1550
00:35:54,200 --> 00:35:54,210



1551
00:35:54,210 --> 00:35:55,670
so one flies through with his rocket

1552
00:35:55,670 --> 00:35:55,680



1553
00:35:55,680 --> 00:35:57,500
cleverly another with his rocket through the

1554
00:35:57,500 --> 00:35:57,510



1555
00:35:57,510 --> 00:35:58,940
other flies like this through and the

1556
00:35:58,940 --> 00:35:58,950



1557
00:35:58,950 --> 00:36:00,890
totality of all these velocities

1558
00:36:00,890 --> 00:36:00,900



1559
00:36:00,900 --> 00:36:03,079

1560
00:36:03,079 --> 00:36:03,089



1561
00:36:03,089 --> 00:36:06,770
yes physically thought that is the

1562
00:36:06,770 --> 00:36:06,780



1563
00:36:06,780 --> 00:36:09,920
tangent space but technically thought

1564
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:09,930



1565
00:36:09,930 --> 00:36:12,530
are the directional derivatives along

1566
00:36:12,530 --> 00:36:12,540



1567
00:36:12,540 --> 00:36:14,480
these curves acting and on arbitrary

1568
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:14,490



1569
00:36:14,490 --> 00:36:16,640
functions

1570
00:36:17,710 --> NaN:NaN:NaN,NaN



1571
00:36:17,720 --> 00:36:22,940
ok so it is okay okay we have here

1572
00:36:22,940 --> 00:36:22,950



1573
00:36:22,950 --> 00:36:26,030
everything okay from so the intuition that

1574
00:36:26,030 --> 00:36:26,040



1575
00:36:26,040 --> 00:36:27,380
I go to I believe that everything that

1576
00:36:27,380 --> 00:36:27,390



1577
00:36:27,390 --> 00:36:28,849
I said is correct and

1578
00:36:28,849 --> 00:36:28,859



1579
00:36:28,859 --> 00:36:29,960
actually cannot be misinterpreted

1580
00:36:29,960 --> 00:36:29,970



1581
00:36:29,970 --> 00:36:32,000
but as is always the case

1582
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:32,010



1583
00:36:32,010 --> 00:36:34,220
all my words are of course only

1584
00:36:34,220 --> 00:36:34,230



1585
00:34:34,230 --> 00:36:35,299
nice talk

1586
00:36:35,299 --> 00:36:35,309



1587
00:36:35,309 --> 00:36:38,059
this is a tangent vector this

1588
00:36:38,059 --> 00:36:38,069



1589
00:36:38,069 --> 00:36:40,099
mapping period you will get used to

1590
00:36:40,099 --> 00:36:40,109



1591
00:36:40,109 --> 00:36:40,640
it

1592
00:36:40,640 --> 00:36:40,650



1593
00:36:40,650 --> 00:36:43,010
ok and you will also see as soon as we

1594
00:36:43,010 --> 00:36:43,020



1595
00:36:43,020 --> 00:36:44,510
have charts we get to that shortly

1596
00:36:44,510 --> 00:36:44,520



1597
00:36:44,520 --> 00:36:46,819
you will say oh I see and hopefully not if

1598
00:36:46,819 --> 00:36:46,829



1599
00:36:46,829 --> 00:36:48,980
yes then you understand me completely a

1600
00:36:48,980 --> 00:36:48,990



1601
00:36:48,990 --> 00:36:51,020
a whole lot but okay let's continue at

1602
00:36:51,020 --> 00:36:51,030



1603
00:36:51,030 --> 00:36:52,220
this point excuse me

1604
00:36:52,220 --> 00:36:52,230



1605
00:36:52,230 --> 00:36:54,289
I don't think you are quite satisfied

1606
00:36:54,289 --> 00:36:54,299



1607
00:36:54,299 --> 00:36:58,700
but comes later good so now I have

1608
00:36:58,700 --> 00:36:58,710



1609
00:36:58,710 --> 00:37:00,650
here again so quite suspiciously

1610
00:37:00,650 --> 00:37:00,660



1611
00:37:00,660 --> 00:37:03,650
written tangent space that is so

1612
00:37:03,650 --> 00:37:03,660



1613
00:37:03,660 --> 00:37:06,859
a set and since in theory

1614
00:37:06,859 --> 00:37:06,869



1615
00:37:06,869 --> 00:37:09,079
structure fanatics are we distinguish

1616
00:37:09,079 --> 00:37:09,089



1617
00:37:09,089 --> 00:37:11,150
this now first the collection of all

1618
00:37:11,150 --> 00:37:11,160



1619
00:37:11,160 --> 00:37:14,359
these tangent vectors at a

1620
00:37:14,359 --> 00:37:14,369



1621
00:37:14,369 --> 00:37:16,849
point not vector here and vector there

1622
00:37:16,849 --> 00:37:16,859



1623
00:37:16,859 --> 00:37:19,010
you see this is for example such a

1624
00:37:19,010 --> 00:37:19,020



1625
00:37:19,020 --> 00:37:19,520
thing

1626
00:37:19,520 --> 00:37:19,530



1627
00:37:19,530 --> 00:37:23,030
our vectors here they all live they

1628
00:37:23,030 --> 00:37:23,040



1629
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:26,120
all have at point p if we from the

1630
00:37:26,120 --> 00:37:26,130



1631
00:37:26,130 --> 00:37:27,920
vectors with another at point

1632
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:27,930



1633
00:37:27,930 --> 00:37:30,230
talk that is a completely different set with

1634
00:37:30,230 --> 00:37:30,240



1635
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:32,059
which we initially have nothing to do at all

1636
00:37:32,059 --> 00:37:32,069



1637
00:37:32,069 --> 00:37:35,809
ok first one point so and now is

1638
00:37:35,809 --> 00:37:35,819



1639
00:37:35,819 --> 00:37:37,990
the question can I actually two

1640
00:37:37,990 --> 00:37:38,000



1641
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:41,150
tangent vectors that these mappings

1642
00:37:41,150 --> 00:37:41,160



1643
00:37:41,160 --> 00:37:43,099
are can I actually add them

1644
00:37:43,099 --> 00:37:43,109



1645
00:37:43,109 --> 00:37:46,490
and the answer is yes I can

1646
00:37:46,490 --> 00:37:46,500



1647
00:37:46,500 --> 00:37:49,220
I now do the following I

1648
00:37:49,220 --> 00:37:49,230



1649
00:37:49,230 --> 00:37:53,500
now define an addition that is called

1650
00:37:53,500 --> 00:37:53,510



1651
00:37:53,510 --> 00:37:58,160
T subscript p plus and T subscript p plus takes

1652
00:37:58,160 --> 00:37:58,170



1653
00:37:58,170 --> 00:38:04,010
now two tangent vectors at p and

1654
00:38:04,010 --> 00:38:04,020



1655
00:38:04,020 --> 00:38:06,559
makes from them a new tangent

1656
00:38:06,559 --> 00:38:06,569



1657
00:38:06,569 --> 00:38:09,859
vector at point p how does it do that

1658
00:38:09,859 --> 00:38:09,869



1659
00:38:09,869 --> 00:38:11,599
actually I just need to tell you it

1660
00:38:11,599 --> 00:38:11,609



1661
00:36:11,609 --> 00:38:15,140
does that pointwise I tell you

1662
00:38:15,140 --> 00:38:15,150



1663
00:38:15,150 --> 00:38:16,700
it does that only pointwise and what do you

1664
00:38:16,700 --> 00:38:16,710



1665
00:38:16,710 --> 00:38:19,549
tell me then then you tell me aha then

1666
00:38:19,549 --> 00:38:19,559



1667
00:38:19,559 --> 00:38:22,220
you take such an X and then

1668
00:38:22,220 --> 00:38:22,230



1669
00:38:22,230 --> 00:38:24,309
you take such a Y

1670
00:38:24,309 --> 00:38:24,319



1671
00:38:24,319 --> 00:38:26,809
these are elements in here good you

1672
00:38:26,809 --> 00:38:26,819



1673
00:38:26,819 --> 00:38:28,039
can of course say you take an

1674
00:38:28,039 --> 00:38:28,049



1675
00:38:28,049 --> 00:38:31,010
X subscript gamma and a X subscript delta that's what

1676
00:38:31,010 --> 00:38:31,020



1677
00:38:31,020 --> 00:38:32,510
the comrades who live in there are called

1678
00:38:32,510 --> 00:38:32,520



1679
00:38:32,520 --> 00:38:33,970
these are both

1680
00:38:33,970 --> 00:38:33,980



1681
00:38:33,980 --> 00:38:37,560
tangent vectors at this point p ok

1682
00:38:37,560 --> 00:38:37,570



1683
00:38:37,570 --> 00:38:42,190
and you say their sum you want

1684
00:38:42,190 --> 00:38:42,200



1685
00:38:42,200 --> 00:38:43,440
to define now

1686
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:43,450



1687
00:38:43,450 --> 00:38:45,520
now I tell you you do that

1688
00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:45,530



1689
00:38:45,530 --> 00:38:48,520
pointwise that means adding

1690
00:38:48,520 --> 00:38:48,530



1691
00:38:48,530 --> 00:38:50,920
mappings what do you have to do when

1692
00:38:50,920 --> 00:38:50,930



1693
00:38:50,930 --> 00:38:52,630
you want to define a mapping point this

1694
00:38:52,630 --> 00:38:52,640



1695
00:38:52,640 --> 00:38:55,560
operation pointwise

1696
00:38:55,560 --> 00:38:55,570



1697
00:38:55,570 --> 00:39:09,490
what do we then have to say exactly

1698
00:39:09,490 --> 00:39:09,500



1699
00:39:09,500 --> 00:39:11,109
it is great and now only the

1700
00:39:11,109 --> 00:39:11,119



1701
00:39:11,119 --> 00:39:13,540
question what is in this context what I

1702
00:39:13,540 --> 00:39:13,550



1703
00:39:13,550 --> 00:39:19,180
for these mappings one point right

1704
00:39:19,180 --> 00:39:19,190



1705
00:39:19,190 --> 00:39:22,450
perfect yes of course very very good very

1706
00:39:22,450 --> 00:39:22,460



1707
00:39:22,460 --> 00:39:25,210
good that in mappings they eat

1708
00:39:25,210 --> 00:39:25,220



1709
00:39:25,220 --> 00:39:27,130
functions and spit out real numbers

1710
00:39:27,130 --> 00:39:27,140



1711
00:39:27,140 --> 00:39:29,410
very nice on that I can namely


1712
00:39:29,410 --> 00:39:29,420



1713
00:39:29,420 --> 00:39:31,680
add and pointwise means here

1714
00:39:31,680 --> 00:39:31,690



1715
00:39:31,690 --> 00:39:35,280
function-wise okay so this thing

1716
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:35,290



1717
00:39:35,290 --> 00:39:38,200
I throw on a point namely on

1718
00:39:38,200 --> 00:39:38,210



1719
00:39:38,210 --> 00:39:40,060
what they act on that was again

1720
00:39:40,060 --> 00:39:40,070



1721
00:39:40,070 --> 00:39:40,990
a function

1722
00:39:40,990 --> 00:39:41,000



1723
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:42,520
and now I have to construct a real number

1724
00:39:42,520 --> 00:39:42,530



1725
00:39:42,530 --> 00:39:45,720
I do that pointwise

1726
00:39:45,720 --> 00:39:45,730



1727
00:39:45,730 --> 00:39:49,510
X subscript p I first let act on f or

1728
00:39:49,510 --> 00:39:49,520



1729
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:50,680
I've mostly written the bracket

1730
00:39:50,680 --> 00:39:50,690



1731
00:39:50,690 --> 00:39:52,750
it acts directly on f and

1732
00:39:52,750 --> 00:39:52,760



1733
00:39:52,760 --> 00:39:54,730
then comes plus this is a plus the

1734
00:39:54,730 --> 00:39:54,740



1735
00:39:54,740 --> 00:39:56,770
plus on the real numbers since that there

1736
00:39:56,770 --> 00:39:56,780



1737
00:39:56,780 --> 00:39:58,870
is a real number and understand here

1738
00:39:58,870 --> 00:39:58,880



1739
00:39:58,880 --> 00:40:03,340
X subscript delta at p of f acts exactly that

1740
00:40:03,340 --> 00:40:03,350



1741
00:40:03,350 --> 00:40:07,270
is pointwise and exactly so we can

1742
00:40:07,270 --> 00:40:07,280



1743
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:11,109
define here a T subscript p times that should

1744
00:40:11,109 --> 00:40:11,119



1745
00:40:11,119 --> 00:40:13,330
now actually also again be such a

1746
00:40:13,330 --> 00:40:13,340



1747
00:40:13,340 --> 00:40:15,970
scaling so I want here a

1748
00:40:15,970 --> 00:40:15,980



1749
00:40:15,980 --> 00:40:20,470
real number with a vector a

1750
00:40:20,470 --> 00:40:20,480



1751
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:23,380
real number scale and I do

1752
00:40:23,380 --> 00:40:23,390



1753
00:40:23,390 --> 00:40:24,880
that also pointwise I won't write

1754
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:24,890



1755
00:40:24,890 --> 00:40:26,290
that down at all you have already

1756
00:40:26,290 --> 00:40:26,300



1757
00:40:26,300 --> 00:40:27,510
understood that

1758
00:40:27,510 --> 00:40:27,520



1759
00:40:27,520 --> 00:40:32,650
ok pointwise yes and you already suspect

1760
00:40:32,650 --> 00:40:32,660



1761
00:40:32,660 --> 00:40:34,990
where this leads one can now

1762
00:40:34,990 --> 00:40:35,000



1763
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:39,020
again show let's have proposition

1764
00:40:39,020 --> 00:40:39,030



1765
00:40:39,030 --> 00:40:41,960
that if I now at a point

1766
00:40:41,960 --> 00:40:41,970



1767
00:40:41,970 --> 00:40:44,630
take the collection of all directional derivatives

1768
00:40:44,630 --> 00:40:44,640



1769
00:40:44,640 --> 00:40:47,000
which we also call tangent vectors

1770
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:47,010



1771
00:40:47,010 --> 00:40:50,900
and I equip this set

1772
00:40:50,900 --> 00:40:50,910



1773
00:40:50,910 --> 00:40:53,480
with this type of addition and this

1774
00:40:53,480 --> 00:40:53,490



1775
00:40:53,490 --> 00:40:55,490
type of scalar multiplication or

1776
00:40:55,490 --> 00:40:55,500



1777
00:40:55,500 --> 00:40:58,340
scaling then this is again a real

1778
00:40:58,340 --> 00:40:58,350



1779
00:40:58,350 --> 00:41:00,340
a real vector space

1780
00:41:00,340 --> 00:41:00,350



1781
00:41:00,350 --> 00:41:07,940
ok so in any case these

1782
00:41:07,940 --> 00:41:07,950



1783
00:41:07,950 --> 00:41:10,930
directional derivatives form a vector space

1784
00:41:10,930 --> 00:41:10,940



1785
00:41:10,940 --> 00:41:14,570
because with these operations they satisfy

1786
00:41:14,570 --> 00:41:14,580



1787
00:41:14,580 --> 00:41:16,880
the properties of a vector space and

1788
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:16,890



1789
00:41:16,890 --> 00:41:18,740
this thing is called the tangent

1790
00:41:18,740 --> 00:41:18,750



1791
00:41:18,750 --> 00:41:25,420
vector space at point p that is the

1792
00:41:25,420 --> 00:41:25,430



1793
00:41:25,430 --> 00:41:28,240
tangent vector space at point p

1794
00:41:28,240 --> 00:41:28,250



1795
00:41:28,250 --> 00:41:31,420
ok and that means when you in physics

1796
00:41:31,420 --> 00:41:31,430



1797
00:41:31,430 --> 00:41:33,230
add velocities

1798
00:41:33,230 --> 00:41:33,240



1799
00:41:33,240 --> 00:41:35,480
at one at one and the same point

1800
00:41:35,480 --> 00:41:35,490



1801
00:41:35,490 --> 00:41:39,170
of course only then you use this

1802
00:41:39,170 --> 00:41:39,180



1803
00:41:39,180 --> 00:41:43,010
box plus function the vector addition

1804
00:41:43,010 --> 00:41:43,020



1805
00:41:43,020 --> 00:41:45,950
of vectors at the same point is

1806
00:41:45,950 --> 00:41:45,960



1807
00:41:45,960 --> 00:41:52,610
this box plus that is it okay here

1808
00:41:52,610 --> 00:41:52,620



1809
00:41:52,620 --> 00:41:53,810
we will of course also again leave out

1810
00:41:53,810 --> 00:41:53,820



1811
00:41:53,820 --> 00:41:56,300
the box in future that is now only

1812
00:41:56,300 --> 00:41:56,310



1813
00:41:56,310 --> 00:41:57,830
to make clear this is not the

1814
00:41:57,830 --> 00:41:57,840



1815
00:41:57,840 --> 00:41:59,780
plus on this but through this plus

1816
00:41:59,780 --> 00:41:59,790



1817
00:41:59,790 --> 00:42:02,590
on R ultimately often on this plus on

1818
00:42:02,590 --> 00:42:02,600



1819
00:42:02,600 --> 00:42:12,920
reduced questions so far so you

1820
00:42:12,920 --> 00:42:12,930



1821
00:42:12,930 --> 00:42:14,480
will the deeper meaning of this

1822
00:42:14,480 --> 00:42:14,490



1823
00:42:14,490 --> 00:42:17,180
abstraction that was made here

1824
00:42:17,180 --> 00:42:17,190



1825
00:42:17,190 --> 00:42:18,530
immediately recognize

1826
00:42:18,530 --> 00:42:18,540



1827
00:42:18,540 --> 00:42:20,660
so until now it is quite abstract

1828
00:42:20,660 --> 00:42:20,670



1829
00:42:20,670 --> 00:42:22,850
and probably quite different from

1830
00:42:22,850 --> 00:42:22,860



1831
00:42:22,860 --> 00:42:24,350
everything you about velocity

1832
00:42:24,350 --> 00:42:24,360



1833
00:42:24,360 --> 00:42:26,510
thought besides said in

1834
00:42:26,510 --> 00:42:26,520



1835
00:42:26,520 --> 00:42:29,320
childhood but you have forgotten that

1836
00:42:29,320 --> 00:42:29,330



1837
00:42:29,330 --> 00:42:33,050
now we make the contact with what

1838
00:42:33,050 --> 00:42:33,060



1839
00:42:33,060 --> 00:42:34,850
you know about velocities or

1840
00:42:34,850 --> 00:42:34,860



1841
00:42:34,860 --> 00:42:37,040
believe to know namely that when you

1842
00:42:37,040 --> 00:42:37,050



1843
00:42:37,050 --> 00:42:39,500
are in a certain chart that you

1844
00:42:39,500 --> 00:42:39,510



1845
00:42:39,510 --> 00:42:41,270
can understand the velocity

1846
00:42:41,270 --> 00:42:41,280



1847
00:42:41,280 --> 00:42:44,210
as a collection of components

1848
00:42:44,210 --> 00:42:44,220



1849
00:42:44,220 --> 00:42:46,340
of this velocity yes that would then be

1850
00:42:46,340 --> 00:42:46,350



1851
00:42:46,350 --> 00:42:48,920
the tuple of the velocities

1852
00:42:48,920 --> 00:42:48,930



1853
00:42:48,930 --> 00:42:51,890
x y z direction or something like that but what we

1854
00:42:51,890 --> 00:42:51,900



1855
00:42:51,900 --> 00:42:52,510
do for that

1856
00:42:52,510 --> 00:42:52,520



1857
00:42:52,520 --> 00:42:55,120
it is to introduce a chart that is the

1858
00:42:55,120 --> 00:42:55,130



1859
00:42:55,130 --> 00:42:57,520
next step

1860
00:43:17,430 --> NaN:NaN:NaN,NaN



1861
00:43:17,440 --> 00:43:27,010
fourth is situation considered on chart

1862
00:43:27,010 --> 00:43:27,020



1863
00:43:27,020 --> 00:43:29,530
level

1864
00:43:34,019 --> NaN:NaN:NaN,NaN



1865
00:43:34,029 --> 00:43:38,430
so good how do we do that now

1866
00:43:38,430 --> 00:43:38,440



1867
00:43:38,440 --> 00:43:40,660
we just write down what

1868
00:43:40,660 --> 00:43:40,670



1869
00:43:40,670 --> 00:43:45,910
we have so we want this object

1870
00:43:45,910 --> 00:43:45,920



1871
00:43:45,920 --> 00:43:49,029
X subscript p this directional derivative along

1872
00:43:49,029 --> 00:43:49,039



1873
00:43:49,039 --> 00:43:50,920
gamma at p or called the

1874
00:43:50,920 --> 00:43:50,930



1875
00:43:50,930 --> 00:43:55,059
tangent vector to gamma at p on

1876
00:43:55,059 --> 00:43:55,069



1877
00:43:55,069 --> 00:44:04,690
chart level understand yes good if one

1878
00:44:04,690 --> 00:44:04,700



1879
00:44:04,700 --> 00:44:06,069
first make clear what are the

1880
00:44:06,069 --> 00:44:06,079



1881
00:44:06,079 --> 00:44:10,329
abstract ingredients the ingredients are

1882
00:44:10,329 --> 00:44:10,339



1883
00:44:10,339 --> 00:44:12,339
first of all a curve gamma

1884
00:44:12,339 --> 00:44:12,349



1885
00:44:12,349 --> 00:44:18,089
that runs on the manifold okay

1886
00:44:18,089 --> 00:44:18,099



1887
00:44:18,099 --> 00:44:21,519
and there again a function but it

1888
00:44:21,519 --> 00:44:21,529



1889
00:44:21,529 --> 00:44:22,720
is quite arbitrary so are

1890
00:44:22,720 --> 00:44:22,730



1891
00:44:22,730 --> 00:44:24,370
arbitrary smooth functions on which this

1892
00:44:24,370 --> 00:44:24,380



1893
00:44:24,380 --> 00:44:25,269
can act

1894
00:44:25,269 --> 00:44:25,279



1895
00:44:25,279 --> 00:44:27,630
okay that was this situation but

1896
00:44:27,630 --> 00:44:27,640



1897
00:44:27,640 --> 00:44:30,880
if we now yes still choose a chart

1898
00:44:30,880 --> 00:44:30,890



1899
00:44:30,890 --> 00:44:33,190
we want to consider it in a chart

1900
00:44:33,190 --> 00:44:33,200



1901
00:44:33,200 --> 00:44:36,309
there would be a chart from our

1902
00:44:36,309 --> 00:44:36,319



1903
00:44:36,319 --> 00:44:39,009
nice smooth atlas it is however

1904
00:44:39,009 --> 00:44:39,019



1905
00:44:39,019 --> 00:44:41,109
of course clever if the point at

1906
00:44:41,109 --> 00:44:41,119



1907
00:44:41,119 --> 00:44:43,180
which we want to consider the situation

1908
00:44:43,180 --> 00:44:43,190



1909
00:44:43,190 --> 00:44:46,599
it should of course lie within the chart

1910
00:44:46,599 --> 00:44:46,609



1911
00:44:46,609 --> 00:44:49,390
domain yes makes no sense

1912
00:44:49,390 --> 00:44:49,400



1913
00:44:49,400 --> 00:44:51,460
if we consider that elsewhere so

1914
00:44:51,460 --> 00:44:51,470



1915
00:44:51,470 --> 00:44:54,630
again wildtier manifold

1916
00:44:54,630 --> 00:44:54,640



1917
00:44:54,640 --> 00:45:02,109
curve gun smoke and that here this is

1918
00:45:02,109 --> 00:45:02,119



1919
00:45:02,119 --> 00:45:04,809
now the chart domain and you know

1920
00:45:04,809 --> 00:45:04,819



1921
00:45:04,819 --> 00:45:06,670
that chart domain that can then

1922
00:45:06,670 --> 00:45:06,680



1923
00:45:06,680 --> 00:45:09,870
be mapped into R to the d

1924
00:45:09,870 --> 00:45:09,880



1925
00:45:09,880 --> 00:45:12,069
and there it lies then now somehow there

1926
00:45:12,069 --> 00:45:12,079



1927
00:45:12,079 --> 00:45:13,319
as x of u

1928
00:45:13,319 --> 00:45:13,329



1929
00:45:13,329 --> 00:45:16,509
as subset of R to the d and likewise

1930
00:45:16,509 --> 00:45:16,519



1931
00:45:16,519 --> 00:45:19,170
of course the curve point by point

1932
00:45:19,170 --> 00:45:19,180



1933
00:45:19,180 --> 00:45:25,269
is mapped there lies okay the chart there


1934
00:45:25,269 --> 00:45:25,279



1935
00:45:25,279 --> 00:45:27,160
I of course only consider here

1936
00:45:27,160 --> 00:45:27,170



1937
00:45:27,170 --> 00:45:30,339
a chart domain in which that lands

1938
00:45:30,339 --> 00:45:30,349



1939
00:45:30,349 --> 00:45:32,559
and you know if that now exactly

1940
00:45:32,559 --> 00:45:32,569



1941
00:45:32,569 --> 00:45:34,210
take we then also have to here

1942
00:45:34,210 --> 00:45:34,220



1943
00:45:34,220 --> 00:45:37,120
restrict the parameter domain that

1944
00:45:37,120 --> 00:45:37,130



1945
00:45:37,130 --> 00:45:40,319
is the preimage with respect to gamma and

1946
00:45:40,319 --> 00:45:40,329



1947
00:45:40,329 --> 00:45:42,789
the restriction of the function u on

1948
00:45:42,789 --> 00:45:42,799



1949
00:45:42,799 --> 00:45:45,039
this domain good given I leave

1950
00:45:45,039 --> 00:45:45,049



1951
00:45:45,049 --> 00:45:45,819
this and

1952
00:45:45,819 --> 00:45:45,829



1953
00:45:45,829 --> 00:45:48,239
must go that is a bit confusing

1954
00:45:48,239 --> 00:45:48,249



1955
00:45:48,249 --> 00:45:51,190
this is the situation so and now you

1956
00:45:51,190 --> 00:45:51,200



1957
00:45:51,200 --> 00:45:52,719
have but and that is of course the trick

1958
00:45:52,719 --> 00:45:52,729



1959
00:45:52,729 --> 00:45:53,769
with the chart

1960
00:45:53,769 --> 00:45:53,779



1961
00:45:53,779 --> 00:45:55,989
you have a chart map x that

1962
00:45:55,989 --> 00:45:55,999



1963
00:45:55,999 --> 00:45:58,390
maps u and then x of u that is

1964
00:45:58,390 --> 00:45:58,400



1965
00:45:58,400 --> 00:46:00,279
a subset of R^d you understand

1966
00:46:00,279 --> 00:46:00,289



1967
00:46:00,289 --> 00:46:02,079
very well and now you can of course

1968
00:46:02,079 --> 00:46:02,089



1969
00:46:02,089 --> 00:46:05,859
here the chart representation of the curve x

1970
00:46:05,859 --> 00:46:05,869



1971
00:46:05,869 --> 00:46:08,440
after gamma indicate and here the

1972
00:46:08,440 --> 00:46:08,450



1973
00:46:08,450 --> 00:46:12,959
chart representation of the function f after x inverse

1974
00:46:12,959 --> 00:46:12,969



1975
00:46:12,969 --> 00:46:18,329
ok course of the ship painted in the atlas

1976
00:46:18,329 --> 00:46:18,339



1977
00:46:18,339 --> 00:46:20,499
temperature distribution of the sea a

1978
00:46:20,499 --> 00:46:20,509



1979
00:46:20,509 --> 00:46:23,249
painted atlas true course of the ship

1980
00:46:23,249 --> 00:46:23,259



1981
00:46:23,259 --> 00:46:26,109
true temperature distribution each in the

1982
00:46:26,109 --> 00:46:26,119



1983
00:46:26,119 --> 00:46:30,219
world okay that is here the question

1984
00:46:32,339 --> NaN:NaN:NaN,NaN



1985
00:46:32,349 --> 00:46:34,900
that is this logic these are our

1986
00:46:34,900 --> 00:46:34,910



1987
00:46:34,910 --> 00:46:38,170
ingredients and now we want this

1988
00:46:38,170 --> 00:46:38,180



1989
00:46:38,180 --> 00:46:41,499
comrade to understand with respect to these

1990
00:46:41,499 --> 00:46:41,509



1991
00:46:41,509 --> 00:46:47,349
ingredients and I think I could use

1992
00:46:47,349 --> 00:46:47,359



1993
00:46:47,359 --> 00:46:49,989
a new board

1994
00:46:57,430 --> NaN:NaN:NaN,NaN



1995
00:46:57,440 --> 00:47:00,609
well we can start here and we

1996
00:47:00,609 --> 00:47:00,619



1997
00:47:00,619 --> 00:47:02,640
let's start here on the left

1998
00:47:02,640 --> 00:47:02,650



1999
00:47:02,650 --> 00:47:04,990
so how do I do that now yes quite

2000
00:47:04,990 --> 00:47:05,000



2001
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:08,170
simple the simplest calculations or

2002
00:47:08,170 --> 00:47:08,180



2003
00:47:08,180 --> 00:47:10,390
almost all calculations that is a tip

2004
00:47:10,390 --> 00:47:10,400



2005
00:47:10,400 --> 00:47:12,339
you can do by starting at the front

2006
00:47:12,339 --> 00:47:12,349



2007
00:47:12,349 --> 00:47:13,660
writing lots of equal signs

2008
00:47:13,660 --> 00:47:13,670



2009
00:47:13,670 --> 00:47:17,710
yes so I want what do I

2010
00:47:17,710 --> 00:47:17,720



2011
00:47:17,720 --> 00:47:19,809
want to understand I want the object X subscript gamma

2012
00:47:19,809 --> 00:47:19,819



2013
00:47:19,819 --> 00:47:23,500
to get to know better

2014
00:47:23,500 --> 00:47:23,510



2015
00:47:23,510 --> 00:47:26,109
so I take it and what do I

2016
00:47:26,109 --> 00:47:26,119



2017
00:47:26,119 --> 00:47:28,540
do with it yes good what can I do

2018
00:47:28,540 --> 00:47:28,550



2019
00:47:28,550 --> 00:47:30,069
first of all nothing what is the

2020
00:47:30,069 --> 00:47:30,079



2021
00:47:30,079 --> 00:47:31,540
definition I learn it better

2022
00:47:31,540 --> 00:47:31,550



2023
00:47:31,550 --> 00:47:33,220
when I let it act on an arbitrary

2024
00:47:33,220 --> 00:47:33,230



2025
00:47:33,230 --> 00:47:36,609
function f why do I learn

2026
00:47:36,609 --> 00:47:36,619



2027
00:47:36,619 --> 00:47:38,589
it better then then I have by

2028
00:47:38,589 --> 00:47:38,599



2029
00:47:38,599 --> 00:47:42,550
definition I know this is f after

2030
00:47:42,550 --> 00:47:42,560



2031
00:47:42,560 --> 00:47:45,309
gamma I look at how the temperature

2032
00:47:45,309 --> 00:47:45,319



2033
00:47:45,319 --> 00:47:46,839
changes when I along the curve gamma

2034
00:47:46,839 --> 00:47:46,849



2035
00:47:46,849 --> 00:47:48,700
walk along how it changes I must

2036
00:47:48,700 --> 00:47:48,710



2037
00:47:48,710 --> 00:47:51,040
differentiate the result that is only

2038
00:47:51,040 --> 00:47:51,050



2039
00:47:51,050 --> 00:47:55,660
still a function of R and that I

2040
00:47:55,660 --> 00:47:55,670



2041
00:47:55,670 --> 00:47:58,089
differentiate at the position lambda zero

2042
00:47:58,089 --> 00:47:58,099



2043
00:47:58,099 --> 00:47:59,859
yes if I write lambda zero here

2044
00:47:59,859 --> 00:47:59,869
