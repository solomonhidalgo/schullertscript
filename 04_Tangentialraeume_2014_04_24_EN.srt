00:00:08,259 --> 00:00:08,269



3
00:00:08,269 --> 00:00:10,910
so good morning welcome back to the

4
00:00:10,910 --> 00:00:10,920



5
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:15,640
lecture today we will be dealing with

6
00:00:15,640 --> 00:00:15,650



7
00:00:15,650 --> 00:00:18,740
tangent vectors and it is indeed

8
00:00:18,740 --> 00:00:18,750



9
00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:21,010
one of the technical

10
00:00:21,010 --> 00:00:21,020



11
00:00:21,020 --> 00:00:24,050
key concepts in mechanics and

12
00:00:24,050 --> 00:00:24,060



13
00:00:24,060 --> 00:00:25,550
we will of course develop this based on

14
00:00:25,550 --> 00:00:25,560



15
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:27,650
the best of what we have done so far

16
00:00:27,650 --> 00:00:27,660



17
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:31,550
but the intuition is probably

18
00:00:31,550 --> 00:00:31,560



19
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:33,979
familiar to all of you imagine you are

20
00:00:33,979 --> 00:00:33,989



21
00:00:33,989 --> 00:00:36,080
moving you have a curve on

22
00:00:36,080 --> 00:00:36,090



23
00:00:36,090 --> 00:00:38,330
a manifold on a

24
00:00:38,330 --> 00:00:38,340



25
00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:41,209
differentiable manifold and

26
00:00:41,209 --> 00:00:41,219



27
00:00:41,219 --> 00:00:43,520
the intuition behind the tangent

28
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:43,530



29
00:00:43,530 --> 00:00:47,029
vector is probably that you are walking and

30
00:00:47,029 --> 00:00:47,039



31
00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:48,920
when at a certain point in time you

32
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:48,930



33
00:00:48,930 --> 00:00:51,049
are somewhere you can for

34
00:00:51,049 --> 00:00:51,059



35
00:00:51,059 --> 00:00:53,360
each specific point in time the

36
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:53,370



37
00:00:53,370 --> 00:00:55,729
tangent vector to this curve

38
00:00:55,729 --> 00:00:55,739



39
00:00:55,739 --> 00:00:58,069
look at or one would physically

40
00:00:58,069 --> 00:00:58,079



41
00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:00,739
also say

42
00:01:06,950 --> NaN:NaN:NaN,NaN



43
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:09,360
one would physically also say the

44
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:09,370



45
00:01:09,370 --> 00:01:12,540
velocity vector and it is actually

46
00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:12,550



47
00:01:12,550 --> 00:01:14,220
quite a nice picture and one

48
00:01:14,220 --> 00:01:14,230



49
00:01:14,230 --> 00:01:15,990
could now think well okay we embed

50
00:01:15,990 --> 00:01:16,000



51
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,850
this manifold in a higher

52
00:01:17,850 --> 00:01:17,860



53
00:01:17,860 --> 00:01:19,830
dimensional space so for example

54
00:01:19,830 --> 00:01:19,840



55
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:22,380
this two-dimensional manifold

56
00:01:22,380 --> 00:01:22,390



57
00:01:22,390 --> 00:01:23,910
here would be embedded in three-dimensional

58
00:01:23,910 --> 00:01:23,920



59
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:27,120
space and can then of course the

60
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:27,130



61
00:01:27,130 --> 00:01:30,030
vectors standing away in three-dimensional space

62
00:01:30,030 --> 00:01:30,040



63
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:33,710
understand wonderfully

64
00:01:33,710 --> 00:01:33,720



65
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:36,840
one can actually do it that way

66
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:36,850



67
00:01:36,850 --> 00:01:39,810
but we do it technically differently for

68
00:01:39,810 --> 00:01:39,820



69
00:01:39,820 --> 00:01:42,810
a technical reason but also for

70
00:01:42,810 --> 00:01:42,820



71
00:01:42,820 --> 00:01:46,230
a philosophical reason because imagine

72
00:01:46,230 --> 00:01:46,240



73
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:47,820
we want with this

74
00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:47,830



75
00:01:47,830 --> 00:01:49,850
manifold to describe the entire universe

76
00:01:49,850 --> 00:01:49,860



77
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:52,760
the entire spacetime even

78
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:52,770



79
00:01:52,770 --> 00:01:56,490
then it would be funny to have to

80
00:01:56,490 --> 00:01:56,500



81
00:01:56,500 --> 00:01:59,219
embed the entire universe in something even larger

82
00:01:59,219 --> 00:01:59,229



83
00:01:59,229 --> 00:02:01,650
and suddenly be able to talk about

84
00:02:01,650 --> 00:02:01,660



85
00:02:01,660 --> 00:02:03,990
velocity vectors of curves

86
00:02:03,990 --> 00:02:04,000



87
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:04,980
to be able to speak of

88
00:02:04,980 --> 00:02:04,990



89
00:02:04,990 --> 00:02:07,580
yes that would then lie outside of the

90
00:02:07,580 --> 00:02:07,590



91
00:02:07,590 --> 00:02:09,570
universe that is at least

92
00:02:09,570 --> 00:02:09,580



93
00:02:09,580 --> 00:02:11,759
philosophically not very nice

94
00:02:11,759 --> 00:02:11,769



95
00:02:11,769 --> 00:02:14,370
and one calls this in differential

96
00:02:14,370 --> 00:02:14,380



97
00:02:14,380 --> 00:02:17,250
geometry one would call this picture

98
00:02:17,250 --> 00:02:17,260



99
00:02:17,260 --> 00:02:20,340
an extrinsic definition or

100
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:20,350



101
00:02:20,350 --> 00:02:23,789
an extrinsic picture of a

102
00:02:23,789 --> 00:02:23,799



103
00:02:23,799 --> 00:02:27,150
tangent vector and what we

104
00:02:27,150 --> 00:02:27,160



105
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:29,240
want to do is an intrinsic

106
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:29,250



107
00:02:29,250 --> 00:02:32,130
definition in which the

108
00:02:32,130 --> 00:02:32,140



109
00:02:32,140 --> 00:02:35,370
velocity does not refer the

110
00:02:35,370 --> 00:02:35,380



111
00:02:35,380 --> 00:02:37,229
definition of the velocity vector

112
00:02:37,229 --> 00:02:37,239



113
00:02:37,239 --> 00:02:39,840
does not refer to the surrounding

114
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:39,850



115
00:02:39,850 --> 00:02:42,900
space and I claim that it is also the

116
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:42,910



117
00:02:42,910 --> 00:02:45,060
much more natural concept if you take

118
00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:45,070



119
00:02:45,070 --> 00:02:47,370
the new exercise sheet there is

120
00:02:47,370 --> 00:02:47,380



121
00:02:47,380 --> 00:02:51,539
a small picture in the upper right and there

122
00:02:51,539 --> 00:02:51,549



123
00:02:51,549 --> 00:02:53,310
it says underneath vector counter

124
00:02:53,310 --> 00:02:53,320



125
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:57,210
that is the speedy driver yes the

126
00:02:57,210 --> 00:02:57,220



127
00:02:57,220 --> 00:03:00,000
vector that is the driver and indeed

128
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:00,010



129
00:03:00,010 --> 00:03:01,949
your earliest childhood memories of

130
00:03:01,949 --> 00:03:01,959



131
00:03:01,959 --> 00:03:03,720
speed are certainly those

132
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:03,730



133
00:03:03,730 --> 00:03:07,020
in the car then you drive in the car and a

134
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:07,030



135
00:03:07,030 --> 00:03:08,789
car has at a certain

136
00:03:08,789 --> 00:03:08,799



137
00:03:08,799 --> 00:03:10,789
point in time a certain speed

138
00:03:10,789 --> 00:03:10,799



139
00:03:10,799 --> 00:03:13,920
okay and indeed speed

140
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:13,930



141
00:03:13,930 --> 00:03:16,080
or velocity vector is indeed

142
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:16,090



143
00:03:16,090 --> 00:03:18,450
a concept that we understand intuitively

144
00:03:18,450 --> 00:03:18,460



145
00:03:18,460 --> 00:03:20,970
and not one that we feel

146
00:03:20,970 --> 00:03:20,980



147
00:03:20,980 --> 00:03:23,640
needs to be defined via an embedding

148
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:23,650



149
00:03:23,650 --> 00:03:25,710
space so the intrinsic

150
00:03:25,710 --> 00:03:25,720



151
00:03:25,460 --> 00:03:28,120
as a child you experience as a child in the car

152
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:28,130



153
00:03:28,130 --> 00:03:35,020
the speed please per year that

154
00:03:35,020 --> 00:03:35,030



155
00:03:35,030 --> 00:03:40,330
is already advanced please yes that

156
00:03:40,330 --> 00:03:40,340



157
00:03:40,340 --> 00:03:42,240
is not advanced enough

158
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:42,250



159
00:03:42,250 --> 00:03:45,580
you look out the window or and there

160
00:03:45,580 --> 00:03:45,590



161
00:03:45,590 --> 00:03:48,070
you see the trees passing by and the like

162
00:03:48,070 --> 00:03:48,080



163
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:50,350
the posts on the side of the road right

164
00:03:50,350 --> 00:03:50,360



165
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:50,650
right

166
00:03:50,650 --> 00:03:50,660



167
00:03:50,660 --> 00:03:53,260
that means you look at your surroundings

168
00:03:53,260 --> 00:03:53,270



169
00:03:53,270 --> 00:03:55,540
and watch how everything flows

170
00:03:55,540 --> 00:03:55,550



171
00:03:55,550 --> 00:03:58,360
past you and you could of course

172
00:03:58,360 --> 00:03:58,370



173
00:03:58,370 --> 00:04:00,160
also instead of putting up some posts there

174
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:00,170



175
00:04:00,170 --> 00:04:01,930
you could also somehow

176
00:04:01,930 --> 00:04:01,940



177
00:04:01,940 --> 00:04:03,340
look there is a mountain range and you

178
00:04:03,340 --> 00:04:03,350



179
00:04:03,350 --> 00:04:05,350
drive past this mountain range and you

180
00:04:05,350 --> 00:04:05,360



181
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:06,550
notice it gets higher and then

182
00:04:06,550 --> 00:04:06,560



183
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:07,479
lower again as you look up through the window

184
00:04:07,479 --> 00:04:07,489



185
00:04:07,489 --> 00:04:08,740
and then hear how it

186
00:04:08,740 --> 00:04:08,750



187
00:04:08,750 --> 00:04:12,100
gets lower or if you now for example drive through

188
00:04:12,100 --> 00:04:12,110



189
00:04:12,110 --> 00:04:13,110
areas with large

190
00:04:13,110 --> 00:04:13,120



191
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:15,850
temperature fluctuations then you

192
00:04:15,850 --> 00:04:15,860



193
00:04:15,860 --> 00:04:17,530
notice or the temperature is hot

194
00:04:17,530 --> 00:04:17,540



195
00:04:17,540 --> 00:04:18,909
or no sense there it gets cold again

196
00:04:18,909 --> 00:04:18,919



197
00:04:18,919 --> 00:04:20,020
noticeably faster you drive so

198
00:04:20,020 --> 00:04:20,030



199
00:04:20,030 --> 00:04:21,880
faster it alternates

200
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:21,890



201
00:04:21,890 --> 00:04:23,890
that means when you drive along a curve

202
00:04:23,890 --> 00:04:23,900



203
00:04:23,900 --> 00:04:27,060
with your car and you observe

204
00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:27,070



205
00:04:27,070 --> 00:04:29,080
a surrounding let us say the

206
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:29,090



207
00:04:29,090 --> 00:04:31,030
function values in the surrounding

208
00:04:31,030 --> 00:04:31,040



209
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:33,010
temperatures mountain heights or such

210
00:04:33,010 --> 00:04:33,020



211
00:04:33,020 --> 00:04:34,770
something that is there and

212
00:04:34,770 --> 00:04:34,780



213
00:04:34,780 --> 00:04:37,810
look how they change while you

214
00:04:37,810 --> 00:04:37,820



215
00:04:37,820 --> 00:04:38,860
drive

216
00:04:38,860 --> 00:04:38,870



217
00:04:38,870 --> 00:04:41,170
the faster they change the

218
00:04:41,170 --> 00:04:41,180



219
00:04:41,180 --> 00:04:43,300
faster you are driving for given mountains

220
00:04:43,300 --> 00:04:43,310



221
00:04:43,310 --> 00:04:45,070
and given temperature distribution right

222
00:04:45,070 --> 00:04:45,080



223
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:47,560
and for trees and whatever else

224
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:47,570



225
00:04:47,570 --> 00:04:48,969
and exactly that is the intrinsic

226
00:04:48,969 --> 00:04:48,979



227
00:04:48,979 --> 00:04:50,770
description there you do not need any

228
00:04:50,770 --> 00:04:50,780



229
00:04:50,780 --> 00:04:52,390
surrounding space you only need

230
00:04:52,390 --> 00:04:52,400



231
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:54,310
on the manifold on which you

232
00:04:54,310 --> 00:04:54,320



233
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:58,180
drive reference functions okay that is

234
00:04:58,180 --> 00:04:58,190



235
00:04:58,190 --> 00:05:00,820
the intuition the extrinsic picture

236
00:05:00,820 --> 00:05:00,830



237
00:05:00,830 --> 00:05:03,060
what I just indicated is the

238
00:05:03,060 --> 00:05:03,070



239
00:05:03,070 --> 00:05:04,870
intrinsic picture and now we make

240
00:05:04,870 --> 00:05:04,880



241
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:09,190
all of this technical and first section

242
00:05:09,190 --> 00:05:09,200



243
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:12,700
smooth functions

244
00:05:15,290 --> NaN:NaN:NaN,NaN



245
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:23,930
and smooth curves so and this is

246
00:05:23,930 --> 00:05:23,940



247
00:05:23,940 --> 00:05:25,700
first of all a reminder of the

248
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:25,710



249
00:05:25,710 --> 00:05:28,460
last lecture

250
00:05:30,670 --> NaN:NaN:NaN,NaN



251
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:33,290
there we had taken something like a

252
00:05:33,290 --> 00:05:33,300



253
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:36,920
smooth manifold and what was that

254
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:36,930



255
00:05:36,930 --> 00:05:38,570
again a smooth manifold

256
00:05:38,570 --> 00:05:38,580



257
00:05:38,580 --> 00:05:40,249
that was in any case a set M

258
00:05:40,249 --> 00:05:40,259



259
00:05:40,259 --> 00:05:43,070
of points then you had a

260
00:05:43,070 --> 00:05:43,080



261
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:44,450
topology so that you at all

262
00:05:44,450 --> 00:05:44,460



263
00:05:44,460 --> 00:05:46,460
manifold becomes a topological

264
00:05:46,460 --> 00:05:46,470



265
00:05:46,470 --> 00:05:49,129
but then we also chose an atlas

266
00:05:49,129 --> 00:05:49,139



267
00:05:49,139 --> 00:05:51,529
and in this case a C

268
00:05:51,529 --> 00:05:51,539



269
00:05:51,539 --> 00:05:53,689
infinity atlas then the

270
00:05:53,689 --> 00:05:53,699



271
00:05:53,699 --> 00:05:55,790
manifold is called smooth and you remember

272
00:05:55,790 --> 00:05:55,800



273
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:57,469
the C infinity atlas only has

274
00:05:57,469 --> 00:05:57,479



275
00:05:57,479 --> 00:05:59,480
charts such that when you consider the chart

276
00:05:59,480 --> 00:05:59,490



277
00:05:59,490 --> 00:06:01,760
transition functions they are

278
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:01,770



279
00:06:01,770 --> 00:06:04,459
as functions from R to the m into R

280
00:06:04,459 --> 00:06:04,469



281
00:06:04,469 --> 00:06:09,950
to the dm smooth arbitrarily often continuously

282
00:06:09,950 --> 00:06:09,960



283
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:11,689
differentiable and this smooth

284
00:06:11,689 --> 00:06:11,699



285
00:06:11,699 --> 00:06:13,700
manifold allows the

286
00:06:13,700 --> 00:06:13,710



287
00:06:13,710 --> 00:06:18,379
definition of smooth functions and since

288
00:06:18,379 --> 00:06:18,389



289
00:06:18,389 --> 00:06:21,820
we will need them again shortly

290
00:06:21,820 --> 00:06:21,830



291
00:06:21,830 --> 00:06:24,260
I will repeat them again we had

292
00:06:24,260 --> 00:06:24,270



293
00:06:24,270 --> 00:06:28,180
said that a function on the

294
00:06:28,180 --> 00:06:28,190



295
00:06:28,190 --> 00:06:33,319
manifold should be called smooth

296
00:06:33,909 --> NaN:NaN:NaN,NaN



297
00:06:33,919 --> 00:06:36,950
if yes and now we need the

298
00:06:36,950 --> 00:06:36,960



299
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:41,689
atlas if for every chart x that you

300
00:06:41,689 --> 00:06:41,699



301
00:06:41,699 --> 00:06:45,439
take from this atlas yes what was

302
00:06:45,439 --> 00:06:45,449



303
00:06:45,449 --> 00:06:46,939
again the condition for smoothness

304
00:06:46,939 --> 00:06:46,949



305
00:06:46,949 --> 00:06:49,279
expressed in the chart nobody can

306
00:06:49,279 --> 00:06:49,289



307
00:06:49,289 --> 00:06:51,469
remember that I cannot either

308
00:06:51,469 --> 00:06:51,479



309
00:06:51,479 --> 00:06:53,570
I always draw myself a picture so how

310
00:06:53,570 --> 00:06:53,580



311
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:55,129
is this we have a chart U that

312
00:06:55,129 --> 00:06:55,139



313
00:06:55,139 --> 00:06:56,089
lies in M

314
00:06:56,089 --> 00:06:56,099



315
00:06:56,099 --> 00:06:58,339
there I can certainly apply f

316
00:06:58,339 --> 00:06:58,349



317
00:06:58,349 --> 00:06:59,240
then it is however

318
00:06:59,240 --> 00:06:59,250



319
00:06:59,250 --> 00:07:01,249
restricted to that which does not hurt us at the moment

320
00:07:01,249 --> 00:07:01,259



321
00:07:01,259 --> 00:07:02,119
does not hurt

322
00:07:02,119 --> 00:07:02,129



323
00:07:02,129 --> 00:07:04,070
then I have here the chart mapping

324
00:07:04,070 --> 00:07:04,080



325
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:05,899
x goes to x of U

326
00:07:05,899 --> 00:07:05,909



327
00:07:05,909 --> 00:07:08,119
but that is a subset of R to the

328
00:07:08,119 --> 00:07:08,129



329
00:07:08,129 --> 00:07:10,309
d yes well the only thing I can

330
00:07:10,309 --> 00:07:10,319



331
00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:12,399
reasonably write here is f

332
00:07:12,399 --> 00:07:12,409



333
00:07:12,409 --> 00:07:15,980
to x inverse yes exactly that was

334
00:07:15,980 --> 00:07:15,990



335
00:07:15,990 --> 00:07:18,619
namely the representation of the function on

336
00:07:18,619 --> 00:07:18,629



337
00:07:18,629 --> 00:07:22,189
the chart instead of in the world world okay

338
00:07:22,189 --> 00:07:22,199



339
00:07:22,199 --> 00:07:24,620
and we wanted to call this C infinity

340
00:07:24,620 --> 00:07:24,630



341
00:07:24,630 --> 00:07:26,480
call it smooth if

342
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:26,490



343
00:07:26,490 --> 00:07:27,970
this here is smooth

344
00:07:27,970 --> 00:07:27,980



345
00:07:27,980 --> 00:07:29,560
down there we can decide that

346
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:29,570



347
00:07:29,570 --> 00:07:32,770
so if for every such chart

348
00:07:32,770 --> 00:07:32,780



349
00:07:32,780 --> 00:07:37,450
the mapping f x inverse which goes from

350
00:07:37,450 --> 00:07:37,460



351
00:07:37,460 --> 00:07:40,260
x of subset of R to the d

352
00:07:40,260 --> 00:07:40,270



353
00:07:40,270 --> 00:07:46,690
to R is smooth as a function

354
00:07:46,690 --> 00:07:46,700



355
00:07:46,700 --> 00:07:49,510
from R to the d into R

356
00:07:49,510 --> 00:07:49,520



357
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:51,220
and you can verify this with the simplest

358
00:07:51,220 --> 00:07:51,230



359
00:07:51,230 --> 00:07:53,530
analytical methods

360
00:07:53,530 --> 00:07:53,540



361
00:07:53,540 --> 00:07:55,180
you remember that was the definition

362
00:07:55,180 --> 00:07:55,190



363
00:07:55,190 --> 00:07:59,110
of smooth function what I

364
00:07:59,110 --> 00:07:59,120



365
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:00,640
had not shown you last time

366
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:00,650



367
00:08:00,650 --> 00:08:02,290
but had already pointed out

368
00:08:02,290 --> 00:08:02,300



369
00:08:02,300 --> 00:08:04,480
that it works exactly the same way is

370
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:04,490



371
00:08:04,490 --> 00:08:07,150
the definition of smooth curve so

372
00:08:07,150 --> 00:08:07,160



373
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:08,920
if you now take a curve gamma

374
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:08,930



375
00:08:08,930 --> 00:08:11,650
which first on a parameter

376
00:08:11,650 --> 00:08:11,660



377
00:08:11,660 --> 00:08:14,070
domain entirely in the manifold

378
00:08:14,070 --> 00:08:14,080



379
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:17,260
lands so here our yellow friend

380
00:08:17,260 --> 00:08:17,270



381
00:08:17,270 --> 00:08:19,600
then you can also call this curve smooth

382
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:19,610



383
00:08:19,610 --> 00:08:20,230
call it

384
00:08:20,230 --> 00:08:20,240



385
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:23,020
there is a new definition that was

386
00:08:23,020 --> 00:08:23,030



387
00:08:23,030 --> 00:08:27,940
only the recycled one is called smooth if well

388
00:08:27,940 --> 00:08:27,950



389
00:08:27,950 --> 00:08:29,500
we want to do this again quite similarly

390
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:29,510



391
00:08:29,510 --> 00:08:30,010
to do

392
00:08:30,010 --> 00:08:30,020



393
00:08:30,020 --> 00:08:32,770
we want to take a chart again

394
00:08:32,770 --> 00:08:32,780



395
00:08:32,780 --> 00:08:35,140
of course from our fancy

396
00:08:35,140 --> 00:08:35,150



397
00:08:35,150 --> 00:08:38,469
C infinity atlas and well this

398
00:08:38,469 --> 00:08:38,479



399
00:08:38,479 --> 00:08:39,969
diagram so that you do not

400
00:08:39,969 --> 00:08:39,979



401
00:08:39,979 --> 00:08:45,990
confuse it later just think of it

402
00:08:45,990 --> 00:08:46,000



403
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,070
and likewise if you want to understand

404
00:08:48,070 --> 00:08:48,080



405
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:50,710
this situation now then think

406
00:08:50,710 --> 00:08:50,720



407
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:52,540
about what it looks like now you

408
00:08:52,540 --> 00:08:52,550



409
00:08:52,550 --> 00:08:55,990
have here if you land in a chart here

410
00:08:55,990 --> 00:08:56,000



411
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,760
then you have you can of course

412
00:08:57,760 --> 00:08:57,770



413
00:08:57,770 --> 00:08:59,560
not take the entire parameter domain

414
00:08:59,560 --> 00:08:59,570



415
00:08:59,570 --> 00:09:02,920
because maybe this set

416
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:02,930



417
00:09:02,930 --> 00:09:04,660
that you select there

418
00:09:04,660 --> 00:09:04,670



419
00:09:04,670 --> 00:09:07,450
there the curve goes in and out and

420
00:09:07,450 --> 00:09:07,460



421
00:09:07,460 --> 00:09:09,640
in and out possibly there you can

422
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:09,650



423
00:09:09,650 --> 00:09:11,770
of course only when you restrict the curve with

424
00:09:11,770 --> 00:09:11,780



425
00:09:11,780 --> 00:09:14,020
this goal you can

426
00:09:14,020 --> 00:09:14,030



427
00:09:14,030 --> 00:09:17,530
of course only take the preimage of the curve of

428
00:09:17,530 --> 00:09:17,540



429
00:09:17,540 --> 00:09:19,960
this under the curve so these are

430
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:19,970



431
00:09:19,970 --> 00:09:21,550
exactly the parameters that lie

432
00:09:21,550 --> 00:09:21,560



433
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:23,710
in there then you have here again

434
00:09:23,710 --> 00:09:23,720



435
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:25,480
the chart mapping goes to x

436
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:25,490



437
00:05:49,490 --> 00:09:28,360
of are subset of the hoped for there we feel

438
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:28,370



439
00:09:28,370 --> 00:09:30,550
at home and here you can

440
00:09:30,550 --> 00:09:30,560



441
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:32,410
now make the successive executions

442
00:09:32,410 --> 00:09:32,420



443
00:09:32,420 --> 00:09:34,300
make now however nothing is after

444
00:09:34,300 --> 00:09:34,310



445
00:09:34,310 --> 00:09:36,820
down there and I only sign that

446
00:09:36,820 --> 00:09:36,830



447
00:09:36,830 --> 00:09:39,040
because mathematically speaking

448
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:39,050



449
00:09:39,050 --> 00:09:40,480
strictly speaking it is already a different

450
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:40,490



451
00:09:40,490 --> 00:09:41,620
curve because it has a different

452
00:09:41,620 --> 00:09:41,630



453
00:09:41,630 --> 00:09:43,630
domain of definition but it is

454
00:09:43,630 --> 00:09:43,640



455
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:45,570
of course defined there just like the

456
00:09:45,570 --> 00:09:45,580



457
00:09:45,580 --> 00:09:47,949
other curve so that is the situation

458
00:09:47,949 --> 00:09:47,959



459
00:09:47,959 --> 00:09:50,139
that we clarify for ourselves in the diagram again

460
00:09:50,139 --> 00:09:50,149



461
00:09:50,149 --> 00:09:53,050
it is also clear that would be

462
00:09:53,050 --> 00:09:53,060



463
00:09:53,060 --> 00:09:55,510
the chart representation of the curve was

464
00:09:55,510 --> 00:09:55,520



465
00:09:55,520 --> 00:09:58,000
that lands here in the chart that is

466
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:58,010



467
00:09:58,010 --> 00:10:00,160
that the course that the captain in the

468
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:00,170



469
00:10:00,170 --> 00:10:02,110
chart draws that is the course that the

470
00:10:02,110 --> 00:10:02,120



471
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:04,449
ship takes in the real world yes and

472
00:10:04,449 --> 00:10:04,459



473
00:10:04,459 --> 00:10:06,579
now we want to call this smooth

474
00:10:06,579 --> 00:10:06,589



475
00:10:06,589 --> 00:10:08,410
yes when where yes if this is smooth

476
00:10:08,410 --> 00:10:08,420



477
00:10:08,420 --> 00:10:13,300
if for all blah blah x following with

478
00:10:13,300 --> 00:10:13,310



479
00:10:13,310 --> 00:10:16,660
exactly this domain and target range

480
00:10:16,660 --> 00:10:16,670



481
00:10:16,670 --> 00:10:23,440
is smooth as a function as a mapping that

482
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:23,450



483
00:10:23,450 --> 00:10:26,110
now goes from R or a part of the first

484
00:10:26,110 --> 00:10:26,120



485
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:28,000
part of the hoped for goes and that we can

486
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:28,010



487
00:10:28,010 --> 00:10:30,639
decide again quite simply you

488
00:10:30,639 --> 00:10:30,649



489
00:10:30,649 --> 00:10:32,410
had function smooth mapping and so

490
00:10:32,410 --> 00:10:32,420



491
00:10:32,420 --> 00:10:33,480
on and so forth

492
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:33,490



493
00:10:33,490 --> 00:10:38,350
so now we have here smooth curves

494
00:10:38,350 --> 00:10:38,360



495
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:40,019
and smooth functions

496
00:10:40,019 --> 00:10:40,029



497
00:10:40,029 --> 00:10:42,430
you are perhaps from school physics

498
00:10:42,430 --> 00:10:42,440



499
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:45,449
accustomed to adding such curves

500
00:10:45,449 --> 00:10:45,459



501
00:10:45,459 --> 00:10:48,370
but it makes no sense at all can

502
00:10:48,370 --> 00:10:48,380



503
00:10:48,380 --> 00:10:50,440
I somehow take a curve gamma and a

504
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:50,450



505
00:10:50,450 --> 00:10:52,240
curve gamma tilde and

506
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:52,250



507
00:10:52,250 --> 00:10:53,139
add them

508
00:10:53,139 --> 00:10:53,149



509
00:10:53,149 --> 00:10:55,240
I would have to do that pointwise but

510
00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:55,250



511
00:10:55,250 --> 00:10:57,550
I have in the target range I have there

512
00:10:57,550 --> 00:10:57,560



513
00:10:57,560 --> 00:10:59,949
no addition it makes absolutely no

514
00:10:59,949 --> 00:10:59,959



515
00:10:59,959 --> 00:11:01,030
you see at all not the

516
00:11:01,030 --> 00:11:01,040



517
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:03,550
structure for that and so in such a real

518
00:11:03,550 --> 00:11:03,560



519
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:07,000
world what is Paris plus Rome supposed to

520
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:07,010



521
00:11:07,010 --> 00:11:08,710
be that does not exist Paris plus Rome

522
00:11:08,710 --> 00:11:08,720



523
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:11,590
makes no sense in the chart you could

524
00:11:11,590 --> 00:11:11,600



525
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:12,910
add you could say I

526
00:11:12,910 --> 00:11:12,920



527
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:14,740
define that as the sum of curves

528
00:11:14,740 --> 00:11:14,750



529
00:11:14,750 --> 00:11:17,260
in the chart there it turns out that

530
00:11:17,260 --> 00:11:17,270



531
00:11:17,270 --> 00:11:19,930
the result would not be chart independent

532
00:09:19,930 --> 00:11:19,940



533
00:11:19,940 --> 00:11:22,180
also not a bad idea it remains

534
00:11:22,180 --> 00:11:22,190



535
00:11:22,190 --> 00:11:24,569
so curves cannot be operated on

536
00:11:24,569 --> 00:11:24,579



537
00:11:24,579 --> 00:11:36,100
however remark differently than curves

538
00:11:38,030 --> NaN:NaN:NaN,NaN



539
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:46,110
one can functions and in particular

540
00:11:46,110 --> 00:11:46,120



541
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:50,780
of course smooth functions add and

542
00:11:50,780 --> 00:11:50,790



543
00:11:50,790 --> 00:11:53,790
scale

544
00:11:54,560 --> NaN:NaN:NaN,NaN



545
00:11:54,570 --> 00:11:57,630
I will explain this once and give it

546
00:11:57,630 --> 00:11:57,640



547
00:11:57,640 --> 00:12:00,180
a name pointwise addition and

548
00:12:00,180 --> 00:12:00,190



549
00:12:00,190 --> 00:12:02,820
scaling and in the future I will only say

550
00:12:02,820 --> 00:12:02,830



551
00:12:02,830 --> 00:12:04,920
pointwise addition or pointwise

552
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:04,930



553
00:12:04,930 --> 00:12:07,410
scaling is defined and then you have to

554
00:12:07,410 --> 00:12:07,420



555
00:12:07,420 --> 00:12:09,990
adapt that to the case where it occurs

556
00:12:09,990 --> 00:12:10,000



557
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,270
okay that saves me spit and is for you

558
00:12:12,270 --> 00:12:12,280



559
00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:15,660
good practice how does that work

560
00:12:15,660 --> 00:12:15,670



561
00:12:15,670 --> 00:12:19,260
so let us take a function let it

562
00:12:19,260 --> 00:12:19,270



563
00:12:19,270 --> 00:12:20,930
so be

564
00:12:20,930 --> 00:12:20,940



565
00:12:20,940 --> 00:12:25,830
f and g be functions on the

566
00:12:25,830 --> 00:12:25,840



567
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:27,720
entire manifold so mappings

568
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:27,730



569
00:12:27,730 --> 00:12:29,840
from M to R

570
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:29,850



571
00:12:29,850 --> 00:12:32,030
then we can define an operation

572
00:12:32,030 --> 00:12:32,040



573
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:34,050
which I will now call

574
00:12:34,050 --> 00:12:34,060



575
00:12:34,060 --> 00:12:36,480
circle plus later we drop the

576
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:36,490



577
00:12:36,490 --> 00:12:38,460
circle but that is too

578
00:12:38,460 --> 00:12:38,470



579
00:12:38,470 --> 00:12:41,610
premature for now so we write the circle

580
00:12:41,610 --> 00:12:41,620



581
00:12:41,620 --> 00:12:43,830
plus and what does this circle plus

582
00:12:43,830 --> 00:12:43,840



583
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:46,890
operation do it takes a function and

584
00:12:46,890 --> 00:12:46,900



585
00:12:46,900 --> 00:12:49,620
takes the types another function and

586
00:12:49,620 --> 00:12:49,630



587
00:12:49,630 --> 00:12:52,790
should make a function out of it again

588
00:12:52,790 --> 00:12:52,800



589
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:58,020
yes so this f plus plus g that should again

590
00:12:58,020 --> 00:12:58,030



591
00:12:58,030 --> 00:13:01,950
in its entirety that should

592
00:12:01,950 --> 00:13:01,960



593
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:05,280
be a function again yes how do we

594
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:05,290



595
00:13:05,290 --> 00:13:07,290
do this define it through

596
00:13:07,290 --> 00:13:07,300



597
00:13:07,300 --> 00:13:10,440
the following specification we say this

598
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:10,450



599
00:13:10,450 --> 00:13:12,450
new function it simply has the name

600
00:13:12,450 --> 00:13:12,460



601
00:13:12,460 --> 00:13:15,840
f circle plus go this new

602
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:15,850



603
00:13:15,850 --> 00:13:18,600
function shall be specified yes

604
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:18,610



605
00:13:18,610 --> 00:13:20,520
by what yes if I define something

606
00:13:20,520 --> 00:13:20,530



607
00:13:20,530 --> 00:13:22,110
I have to reflect back on

608
00:13:22,110 --> 00:13:22,120



609
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:25,110
what is known and what I could do

610
00:13:25,110 --> 00:13:25,120



611
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:27,990
I could evaluate the function f at point

612
00:13:27,990 --> 00:13:28,000



613
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:31,830
m and the function g at

614
00:13:31,830 --> 00:13:31,840



615
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:34,950
the point and then I could these two

616
00:13:34,950 --> 00:13:34,960



617
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:37,350
results where are they located f of m

618
00:13:37,350 --> 00:13:37,360



619
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:43,440
is where so I can there the known

620
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:43,450



621
00:13:43,450 --> 00:13:46,140
addition I will now give you still

622
00:13:46,140 --> 00:13:46,150



623
00:13:46,150 --> 00:13:48,580
here the nickname plus subscript R

624
00:13:48,580 --> 00:13:48,590



625
00:13:48,590 --> 00:13:51,520
I can use that and define

626
00:13:51,520 --> 00:13:51,530



627
00:13:51,530 --> 00:13:54,310
with it an addition between functions

628
00:13:54,310 --> 00:13:54,320



629
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:56,230
the addition between numbers is a

630
00:13:56,230 --> 00:13:56,240



631
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:57,970
number but the addition between two

632
00:13:57,970 --> 00:13:57,980



633
00:13:57,980 --> 00:14:00,730
functions is a function only when

634
00:14:00,730 --> 00:14:00,740



635
00:14:00,740 --> 00:14:02,190
I apply this function again to an

636
00:14:02,190 --> 00:14:02,200



637
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:04,960
element of the domain

638
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:04,970



639
00:14:04,970 --> 00:14:07,830
do I get a number again

640
00:14:07,830 --> 00:14:07,840



641
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:12,460
okay and such a definition here

642
00:14:12,460 --> 00:14:12,470



643
00:14:12,470 --> 00:14:14,350
one gives it a name that is so what

644
00:14:14,350 --> 00:14:14,360



645
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:16,110
it is called it is more of a kind of

646
00:14:16,110 --> 00:14:16,120



647
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:21,000
construction principle this construction

648
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:21,010



649
00:14:21,010 --> 00:14:29,680
this construction is called pointwise

650
00:14:30,000 --> NaN:NaN:NaN,NaN



651
00:14:30,010 --> 00:14:35,920
inheritance pointwise inheritance I know

652
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:35,930



653
00:14:35,930 --> 00:14:38,920
how to add on the target range and

654
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:38,930



655
00:14:38,930 --> 00:14:40,810
then I do it pointwise I

656
00:14:40,810 --> 00:14:40,820



657
00:14:40,820 --> 00:14:42,430
namely for every value on which I

658
00:14:42,430 --> 00:14:42,440



659
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:44,830
evaluate I do it so okay it is in any

660
00:14:44,830 --> 00:14:44,840



661
00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:46,600
case a possibility so that one

662
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:46,610



663
00:14:46,610 --> 00:14:47,620
does not always have to write it so extensively

664
00:14:47,620 --> 00:14:47,630



665
00:14:47,630 --> 00:14:49,210
one writes here

666
00:14:49,210 --> 00:14:49,220



667
00:14:49,220 --> 00:14:51,670
pointwise and now I can of course

668
00:14:51,670 --> 00:14:51,680



669
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:56,500
likewise do a scaling in that

670
00:14:56,500 --> 00:14:56,510



671
00:14:56,510 --> 00:14:57,880
case we are not now interested

672
00:14:57,880 --> 00:14:57,890



673
00:14:57,890 --> 00:14:59,890
in the product between two functions

674
00:14:59,890 --> 00:14:59,900



675
00:14:59,900 --> 00:15:04,210
but we are interested in a

676
00:15:04,210 --> 00:15:04,220



677
00:15:04,220 --> 00:15:06,340
scaling in which I give you a

678
00:15:06,340 --> 00:15:06,350



679
00:15:06,350 --> 00:15:10,380
real number and then I define

680
00:15:10,380 --> 00:15:10,390



681
00:15:10,390 --> 00:15:15,970
let us say a function and I define

682
00:15:15,970 --> 00:15:15,980



683
00:15:15,980 --> 00:15:18,760
that again pointwise by saying

684
00:15:18,760 --> 00:15:18,770



685
00:15:18,770 --> 00:15:22,030
that is alpha times f evaluated at the point

686
00:15:22,030 --> 00:15:22,040



687
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:24,010
and in between I can of course use this

688
00:15:24,010 --> 00:15:24,020



689
00:15:24,020 --> 00:15:25,320
inheritance

690
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:25,330



691
00:15:25,330 --> 00:15:29,680
okay yes it is all quite nice and so what

692
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:29,690



693
00:15:29,690 --> 00:15:31,180
is then of course again a

694
00:15:31,180 --> 00:15:31,190



695
00:15:31,190 --> 00:15:33,760
pointwise inheritance but in this case

696
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:33,770



697
00:15:33,770 --> 00:15:37,810
it is just the pointwise inheritance in

698
00:15:37,810 --> 00:15:37,820



699
00:15:37,820 --> 00:15:39,130
this case is just pointwise

700
00:15:39,130 --> 00:15:39,140



701
00:15:39,140 --> 00:15:43,870
inheritance of multiplication on that

702
00:15:43,870 --> 00:15:43,880



703
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:44,830
this may perhaps appear to you at

704
00:15:44,830 --> 00:15:44,840



705
00:15:44,840 --> 00:15:46,090
first glance a bit unnecessarily

706
00:15:46,090 --> 00:15:46,100



707
00:15:46,100 --> 00:15:48,400
abstract but this is very important also

708
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:48,410



709
00:15:48,410 --> 00:15:50,140
when you learn in school the sum

710
00:15:50,140 --> 00:15:50,150



711
00:15:50,150 --> 00:15:51,730
rule for derivatives

712
00:15:51,730 --> 00:15:51,740



713
00:15:51,740 --> 00:15:54,070
this refers to this plus you

714
00:15:54,070 --> 00:15:54,080



715
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:56,110
are namely differentiating functions not

716
00:15:56,110 --> 00:15:56,120



717
00:15:56,120 --> 00:15:58,480
function values you need to namely here

718
00:15:58,480 --> 00:15:58,490



719
00:15:58,490 --> 00:16:00,670
put the prime when you differentiate first

720
00:16:00,670 --> 00:16:00,680



721
00:16:00,680 --> 00:16:02,079
differentiate then evaluate

722
00:16:02,079 --> 00:16:02,089



723
00:16:02,089 --> 00:16:04,629
so the sum rule for derivatives

724
00:16:04,629 --> 00:16:04,639



725
00:16:04,639 --> 00:16:06,069
also refers here to this plus

726
00:16:06,069 --> 00:16:06,079



727
00:16:06,079 --> 00:16:07,600
well here we cannot so easily

728
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:07,610



729
00:16:07,610 --> 00:16:08,769
differentiate because of functions on the

730
00:16:08,769 --> 00:16:08,779



731
00:16:08,779 --> 00:16:10,059
manifold have we come to that

732
00:16:10,059 --> 00:16:10,069



733
00:16:10,069 --> 00:16:14,220
shortly so this definition stands so

734
00:16:14,220 --> 00:16:14,230



735
00:16:14,230 --> 00:16:19,839
and yes what do I want to say with this

736
00:16:29,320 --> NaN:NaN:NaN,NaN



737
00:16:29,330 --> 00:16:31,790
this is now such a typical case where

738
00:16:31,790 --> 00:16:31,800



739
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:35,900
one recognizes structure and I summarize that

740
00:16:35,900 --> 00:16:35,910



741
00:16:35,910 --> 00:16:40,400
now in a definition definition it

742
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:40,410



743
00:16:40,410 --> 00:16:46,960
denotes C infinity M

744
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:46,970



745
00:16:46,970 --> 00:16:50,420
the set and first of all only a

746
00:16:50,420 --> 00:16:50,430



747
00:16:50,430 --> 00:16:54,460
set C infinity M

748
00:16:54,460 --> 00:16:54,470



749
00:16:54,470 --> 00:16:57,920
that is the collection of all functions

750
00:16:57,920 --> 00:16:57,930



751
00:16:57,930 --> 00:16:59,330
on M

752
00:16:59,330 --> 00:16:59,340



753
00:16:59,340 --> 00:17:01,970
for which it holds that they are in our

754
00:17:01,970 --> 00:17:01,980



755
00:17:01,980 --> 00:17:05,000
defined sense smooth yes well that

756
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:05,010



757
00:17:05,010 --> 00:17:07,100
is simple C infinity is simply

758
00:17:07,100 --> 00:17:07,110



759
00:17:07,110 --> 00:17:09,830
the set of all smooth functions that

760
00:17:09,830 --> 00:17:09,840



761
00:17:09,840 --> 00:17:12,650
is however only a set and we

762
00:17:12,650 --> 00:17:12,660



763
00:17:12,660 --> 00:17:14,720
observe now or one would have to

764
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:14,730



765
00:17:14,730 --> 00:17:17,270
of course verify that if you take this

766
00:17:17,270 --> 00:17:17,280



767
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:20,540
set and you equip it with

768
00:17:20,540 --> 00:17:20,550



769
00:17:20,550 --> 00:17:22,820
the just defined pointwise

770
00:17:22,820 --> 00:17:22,830



771
00:17:22,830 --> 00:17:26,680
addition and scaling or

772
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:26,690



773
00:17:26,690 --> 00:17:30,200
multiplication then this

774
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:30,210



775
00:17:30,210 --> 00:17:38,780
structure fulfills the axioms and you would have

776
00:17:38,780 --> 00:17:38,790



777
00:17:38,790 --> 00:17:42,740
here is the commutative law

778
00:17:42,740 --> 00:17:42,750



779
00:17:42,750 --> 00:17:45,290
associative law law of neutral

780
00:17:45,290 --> 00:17:45,300



781
00:17:45,300 --> 00:17:47,690
element law of inverse element

782
00:17:47,690 --> 00:17:47,700



783
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:50,420
associative law distributive law another

784
00:17:50,420 --> 00:17:50,430



785
00:17:50,430 --> 00:17:52,400
distributive law and the

786
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:52,410



787
00:17:52,410 --> 00:17:54,530
unit law and of which

788
00:17:54,530 --> 00:17:54,540



789
00:17:54,540 --> 00:17:58,700
structure are these the axioms bravo exactly

790
00:17:58,700 --> 00:17:58,710



791
00:17:58,710 --> 00:18:02,110
the whole forms a vector space

792
00:18:02,110 --> 00:18:02,120



793
00:18:02,120 --> 00:18:05,330
that means the smooth functions in

794
00:18:05,330 --> 00:18:05,340



795
00:18:05,340 --> 00:18:07,070
their entirety with these

796
00:18:07,070 --> 00:18:07,080



797
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:09,550
operations form a vector space

798
00:18:09,550 --> 00:18:09,560



799
00:18:09,560 --> 00:18:11,960
are these already the vectors that we

800
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:11,970



801
00:18:11,970 --> 00:18:14,570
are looking for no these have nothing to do

802
00:18:14,570 --> 00:18:14,580



803
00:18:14,580 --> 00:18:16,850
with the vectors we want to construct

804
00:18:16,850 --> 00:18:16,860



805
00:18:16,860 --> 00:18:19,160
at all but we need them as

806
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:19,170



807
00:18:19,170 --> 00:18:21,650
tools to construct them okay so

808
00:18:21,650 --> 00:18:21,660



809
00:18:21,660 --> 00:18:23,570
now here do not let the concept vector

810
00:18:23,570 --> 00:18:23,580



811
00:18:23,580 --> 00:18:27,440
capture you too early

812
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:27,450



813
00:18:27,450 --> 00:18:31,940
please so end that was simply an

814
00:18:31,940 --> 00:18:31,950



815
00:18:31,950 --> 00:18:34,640
observation about these smooth

816
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:34,650



817
00:18:34,650 --> 00:18:38,570
functions which I can add

818
00:18:39,180 --> NaN:NaN:NaN,NaN



819
00:18:39,190 --> 00:18:45,210
next section tangent vectors

820
00:18:48,380 --> NaN:NaN:NaN,NaN



821
00:18:48,390 --> 00:18:50,160
now we come to the concrete

822
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:50,170



823
00:18:50,170 --> 00:18:54,870
definition and I will simply write it

824
00:18:54,870 --> 00:18:54,880



825
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:56,490
down and then we stare at it

826
00:18:56,490 --> 00:18:56,500



827
00:18:56,500 --> 00:19:00,540
together and then everything becomes clear

828
00:19:00,710 --> NaN:NaN:NaN,NaN



829
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:03,330
so now you would hear this is

830
00:19:03,330 --> 00:19:03,340



831
00:19:03,340 --> 00:19:05,340
really the central point here

832
00:19:05,340 --> 00:19:05,350



833
00:19:05,350 --> 00:19:09,240
we now consider a smooth

834
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:09,250



835
00:19:09,250 --> 00:19:16,890
curve let us say any smooth curve

836
00:19:16,890 --> 00:19:16,900



837
00:19:16,900 --> 00:19:27,270
gamma and where some chosen

838
00:19:27,270 --> 00:19:27,280



839
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:29,670
point p through which the curve runs so

840
00:19:29,670 --> 00:19:29,680



841
00:19:29,680 --> 00:19:32,340
I have here some parameter lambda

842
00:19:32,340 --> 00:19:32,350



843
00:19:32,350 --> 00:19:35,580
0 and to this parameter value lambda 0

844
00:19:35,580 --> 00:19:35,590



845
00:19:35,590 --> 00:19:38,300
there the curve should pass through point p

846
00:19:38,300 --> 00:19:38,310



847
00:19:38,310 --> 00:19:40,680
so let me draw a picture again

848
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:40,690



849
00:19:40,690 --> 00:19:45,540
manifold curve and the

850
00:19:45,540 --> 00:19:45,550



851
00:19:45,550 --> 00:19:48,210
curve does us the favor that it

852
00:19:48,210 --> 00:19:48,220



853
00:19:48,220 --> 00:19:50,490
passes through this point p and

854
00:19:50,490 --> 00:19:50,500



855
00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:52,740
it does so at a parameter whose value

856
00:19:52,740 --> 00:19:52,750



857
00:19:52,750 --> 00:19:54,150
lambda 0

858
00:19:54,150 --> 00:19:54,160



859
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:58,220
we consider such a smooth curve

860
00:19:58,220 --> 00:19:58,230



861
00:19:58,230 --> 00:20:05,250
definition then is called now I write

862
00:20:05,250 --> 00:20:05,260



863
00:20:05,260 --> 00:20:06,150
something down first

864
00:20:06,150 --> 00:20:06,160



865
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:10,320
the object is called capital and all our

866
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:10,330



867
00:20:10,330 --> 00:20:12,410
tangent vectors will always be called capital

868
00:20:12,410 --> 00:20:12,420



869
00:20:12,420 --> 00:20:15,990
X Y Z then capital is but

870
00:20:15,990 --> 00:20:16,000



871
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,910
that this is a special capital this is

872
00:20:17,910 --> 00:20:17,920



873
00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:19,890
namely a tangent vector to the

874
00:20:19,890 --> 00:20:19,900



875
00:19:19,900 --> 00:20:22,710
curve at point that the tangent

876
00:20:22,710 --> 00:20:22,720



877
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:25,650
vector to the curve gamma is we index

878
00:20:25,650 --> 00:20:25,660



879
00:20:25,660 --> 00:20:28,140
by saying of the

880
00:20:28,140 --> 00:20:28,150



881
00:20:28,150 --> 00:20:31,890
curve gamma and now we want

882
00:20:31,890 --> 00:20:31,900



883
00:20:31,900 --> 00:20:34,140
but not somewhere I could on this

884
00:20:34,140 --> 00:20:34,150



885
00:20:34,150 --> 00:20:35,730
curve at different places define a

886
00:20:35,730 --> 00:20:35,740



887
00:20:35,740 --> 00:20:37,890
tangent vector I want

888
00:20:37,890 --> 00:20:37,900



889
00:20:37,900 --> 00:20:40,230
it at the place small p I want

890
00:20:40,230 --> 00:20:40,240



891
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:41,910
now so a tangent vector

892
00:20:41,910 --> 00:20:41,920



893
00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:43,830
sorry I only said tangential away

894
00:20:43,830 --> 00:20:43,840



895
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:45,090
forgot again

896
00:20:45,090 --> 00:20:45,100



897
00:20:45,100 --> 00:20:46,860
I will call the thing differently in a moment

898
00:20:46,860 --> 00:20:46,870



899
00:20:46,870 --> 00:20:49,050
invest tangent vector I want this

900
00:20:49,050 --> 00:20:49,060



901
00:20:49,060 --> 00:20:50,250
object here to define

902
00:20:50,250 --> 00:20:50,260



903
00:20:50,260 --> 00:20:52,350
but I really should not have said tangential

904
00:20:52,350 --> 00:20:52,360



905
00:20:52,360 --> 00:20:53,730
away the whole lecture

906
00:20:53,730 --> 00:20:53,740



907
00:20:53,740 --> 00:20:55,760
is messed up

908
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:55,770



909
00:20:55,770 --> 00:21:00,350
so let us start all over again

910
00:21:00,350 --> 00:21:00,360



911
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:02,430
okay we consider only a curve and

912
00:21:02,430 --> 00:21:02,440



913
00:21:02,440 --> 00:21:04,590
now I define such an object there and

914
00:21:04,590 --> 00:21:04,600



915
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:05,760
now you will also see what

916
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:05,770



917
00:21:05,770 --> 00:21:07,710
kind of object this is it does namely

918
00:21:07,710 --> 00:21:07,720



919
00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:10,140
the following it takes namely an

920
00:21:10,140 --> 00:21:10,150



921
00:21:10,150 --> 00:21:13,170
arbitrary element from the vector space

922
00:21:13,170 --> 00:21:13,180



923
00:21:13,180 --> 00:21:16,530
of smooth functions okay with any

924
00:21:16,530 --> 00:21:16,540



925
00:21:16,540 --> 00:21:20,160
smooth function and this object maps

926
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:20,170



927
00:21:20,170 --> 00:21:23,760
any given smooth function on

928
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:23,770



929
00:21:23,770 --> 00:21:25,770
the manifold to only a real

930
00:21:25,770 --> 00:21:25,780



931
00:21:25,780 --> 00:21:29,790
number the way it does it is it does

932
00:21:29,790 --> 00:21:29,800



933
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:35,070
it as follows X subscript gamma P

934
00:21:35,070 --> 00:21:35,080



935
00:21:35,080 --> 00:21:37,290
my goal is the thing simply called think

936
00:21:37,290 --> 00:21:37,300



937
00:21:37,300 --> 00:21:38,310
nothing of it that is simply the

938
00:21:38,310 --> 00:21:38,320



939
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:40,200
nickname of the thing yes not subscript

940
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:40,210



941
00:21:40,210 --> 00:21:44,280
gamma is and in Japan it acts takes so

942
00:21:44,280 --> 00:21:44,290



943
00:21:44,290 --> 00:21:46,980
an element from here yes if I want to

944
00:21:46,980 --> 00:21:46,990



945
00:21:46,990 --> 00:21:48,450
define the mapping I have to say

946
00:21:48,450 --> 00:21:48,460



947
00:21:48,460 --> 00:21:51,180
how it does it and nothing simpler than

948
00:21:51,180 --> 00:21:51,190



949
00:21:51,190 --> 00:22:02,040
that this curve goes to M goes to

950
00:22:02,040 --> 00:22:02,050



951
00:22:02,050 --> 00:22:05,130
with f to R the curve lies here then

952
00:22:05,130 --> 00:22:05,140



953
00:22:05,140 --> 00:22:06,540
I can for example do something like that

954
00:22:06,540 --> 00:22:06,550



955
00:22:06,550 --> 00:22:08,220
when a function of the R yes the

956
00:22:08,220 --> 00:22:08,230



957
00:22:08,230 --> 00:22:11,070
I like it so again only the

958
00:22:11,070 --> 00:22:11,080



959
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:12,660
situation made clear that my

960
00:22:12,660 --> 00:22:12,670



961
00:22:12,670 --> 00:22:14,490
objects that I have what can I do

962
00:22:14,490 --> 00:22:14,500



963
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:17,160
there I can look at f composed with

964
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:17,170



965
00:22:17,170 --> 00:22:19,860
gamma and that is only a function from R to

966
00:22:19,860 --> 00:22:19,870



967
00:22:19,870 --> 00:22:20,580
R

968
00:22:20,580 --> 00:22:20,590



969
00:22:20,590 --> 00:22:23,580
that is not yet a real number but I

970
00:22:23,580 --> 00:22:23,590



971
00:22:23,590 --> 00:22:26,720
take this function and differentiate it

972
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:26,730



973
00:22:26,730 --> 00:22:29,550
with respect to what I can only differentiate with respect to the argument

974
00:22:29,550 --> 00:22:29,560



975
00:22:29,560 --> 00:22:32,820
here in front and evaluate the whole thing

976
00:22:32,820 --> 00:22:32,830



977
00:22:32,830 --> 00:22:37,200
at the parameter value lambda 0

978
00:22:38,000 --> NaN:NaN:NaN,NaN



979
00:22:38,010 --> 00:22:41,340
then this mapping is called then is called

980
00:22:41,340 --> 00:22:41,350



981
00:22:41,350 --> 00:22:44,820
the mapping what kind of

982
00:22:44,820 --> 00:22:44,830



983
00:22:44,830 --> 00:22:46,410
mapping is this what happens when

984
00:22:46,410 --> 00:22:46,420



985
00:22:46,420 --> 00:22:49,110
I take the sum here I take the

986
00:22:49,110 --> 00:22:49,120



987
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:54,120
sum of two functions f plus g what

988
00:22:54,120 --> 00:22:54,130



989
00:22:54,130 --> 00:22:58,140
would then be the result well that would be the

990
00:22:58,140 --> 00:22:58,150



991
00:22:58,150 --> 00:23:02,740
sum X of ps plus X of g

992
00:23:02,740 --> 00:23:02,750



993
00:23:02,750 --> 00:23:05,230
and if I would scale the f with

994
00:23:05,230 --> 00:23:05,240



995
00:23:05,240 --> 00:23:07,870
an alpha I would simply get that out

996
00:23:07,870 --> 00:23:07,880



997
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:10,830
that means this mapping is a

998
00:23:10,830 --> 00:23:10,840



999
00:23:10,840 --> 00:23:14,770
linear mapping when can I speak of

1000
00:23:14,770 --> 00:23:14,780



1001
00:23:14,780 --> 00:23:16,450
linear mapping

1002
00:23:16,450 --> 00:23:16,460



1003
00:23:16,460 --> 00:23:19,090
between two vector spaces I cannot

1004
00:23:19,090 --> 00:23:19,100



1005
00:23:19,100 --> 00:23:20,710
simply say independent linear

1006
00:23:20,710 --> 00:23:20,720



1007
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:22,240
so that I can say the mapping is

1008
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:22,250



1009
00:23:22,250 --> 00:23:23,110
linear

1010
00:23:23,110 --> 00:23:23,120



1011
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:24,580
you know only the addition and

1012
00:23:24,580 --> 00:23:24,590



1013
00:23:24,590 --> 00:23:27,430
scaling must both the domain

1014
00:23:27,430 --> 00:23:27,440



1015
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:29,230
and the target range be a

1016
00:23:29,230 --> 00:23:29,240



1017
00:23:29,240 --> 00:23:31,180
vector space be given now here then

1018
00:23:31,180 --> 00:23:31,190



1019
00:23:31,190 --> 00:23:33,430
the linear mapping X subscript gamma

1020
00:23:33,430 --> 00:23:33,440



1021
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:36,070
this function maps to a real

1022
00:23:36,070 --> 00:23:36,080



1023
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:39,400
number and so defined this is called

1024
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:39,410



1025
00:23:39,410 --> 00:23:42,370
that means the mapping directional

1026
00:23:42,370 --> 00:23:42,380



1027
00:23:42,380 --> 00:23:52,810
derivative directional derivative along

1028
00:23:52,810 --> 00:23:52,820



1029
00:23:52,820 --> 00:23:58,600
gamma along gamma that is the curve at

1030
00:23:58,600 --> 00:23:58,610



1031
00:23:58,610 --> 00:24:05,140
point p okay that's what this thing is called

1032
00:24:05,140 --> 00:24:05,150



1033
00:24:05,150 --> 00:24:07,120
and of course this is of course

1034
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:07,130



1035
00:24:07,130 --> 00:24:09,730
a derivative it acts on things there

1036
00:24:09,730 --> 00:24:09,740



1037
00:24:09,740 --> 00:24:10,990
one could for example check the product

1038
00:24:10,990 --> 00:24:11,000



1039
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:12,460
rule or perhaps

1040
00:24:12,460 --> 00:24:12,470



1041
00:24:12,470 --> 00:24:14,530
apply it to f times g I can also

1042
00:24:14,530 --> 00:24:14,540



1043
00:24:14,540 --> 00:24:18,520
define before we now go on to look at

1044
00:24:18,520 --> 00:24:18,530



1045
00:24:18,530 --> 00:24:20,350
the formal properties

1046
00:24:20,350 --> 00:24:20,360



1047
00:24:20,360 --> 00:24:22,030
let's first build some intuition

1048
00:24:22,030 --> 00:24:22,040



1049
00:24:22,040 --> 00:24:25,450
I claim this is what you as

1050
00:24:25,450 --> 00:24:25,460



1051
00:24:25,460 --> 00:24:28,030
children saw what you as a child

1052
00:24:28,030 --> 00:24:28,040



1053
00:24:28,040 --> 00:24:30,400
perceived as velocity

1054
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:30,410



1055
00:24:30,410 --> 00:24:32,920
before school shaped you they had

1056
00:24:32,920 --> 00:24:32,930



1057
00:24:32,930 --> 00:24:34,480
drilled into you velocity as vector

1058
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:34,490



1059
00:24:34,490 --> 00:24:37,260
component collections

1060
00:24:37,260 --> 00:24:37,270



1061
00:24:37,270 --> 00:24:39,580
but this is what you as children

1062
00:24:39,580 --> 00:24:39,590



1063
00:24:39,590 --> 00:24:41,530
perceived what did you do you

1064
00:24:41,530 --> 00:24:41,540



1065
00:24:41,540 --> 00:24:43,720
got into the car and drove along

1066
00:24:43,720 --> 00:24:43,730



1067
00:24:43,730 --> 00:24:46,360
in the car with dad or mom somewhere

1068
00:24:46,360 --> 00:24:46,370



1069
00:24:46,370 --> 00:24:49,780
along and outside there was something

1070
00:24:49,780 --> 00:24:49,790



1071
00:24:49,790 --> 00:24:52,060
by the roadside trees that kept

1072
00:24:52,060 --> 00:24:52,070



1073
00:24:52,070 --> 00:24:53,740
changing height you have to

1074
00:24:53,740 --> 00:24:53,750



1075
00:24:53,750 --> 00:24:55,270
distinguish the trees somehow

1076
00:24:55,270 --> 00:24:55,280



1077
00:24:55,280 --> 00:24:57,340
they are given by the function

1078
00:24:57,340 --> 00:24:57,350



1079
00:24:57,350 --> 00:24:59,380
this is here that the tree is so that the

1080
00:24:59,380 --> 00:24:59,390



1081
00:24:59,390 --> 00:25:01,510
tree is this tall and so on you drive

1082
00:25:01,510 --> 00:25:01,520



1083
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:03,280
through the forest with lots of

1084
00:25:03,280 --> 00:25:03,290



1085
00:25:03,290 --> 00:25:04,540
differently tall trees

1086
00:25:04,540 --> 00:25:04,550



1087
00:25:04,550 --> 00:25:06,310
that certainly takes work you can also

1088
00:25:06,310 --> 00:25:06,320



1089
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:07,750
take another forest you can take

1090
00:25:07,750 --> 00:25:07,760



1091
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:11,470
any forest yes and you drive

1092
00:25:11,470 --> 00:25:11,480



1093
00:25:11,480 --> 00:25:13,810
through the forest but you don't look at how

1094
00:25:13,810 --> 00:25:13,820



1095
00:25:13,820 --> 00:25:15,460
the trees back there change you

1096
00:25:15,460 --> 00:25:15,470



1097
00:25:15,470 --> 00:25:16,150
only look at how

1098
00:25:16,150 --> 00:25:16,160



1099
00:25:16,160 --> 00:25:18,010
trees where you are right now how they

1100
00:25:18,010 --> 00:25:18,020



1101
00:25:18,020 --> 00:25:19,450
change and you walk through a

1102
00:25:19,450 --> 00:25:19,460



1103
00:25:19,460 --> 00:25:20,020
cave

1104
00:25:20,020 --> 00:25:20,030



1105
00:25:20,030 --> 00:25:22,720
yes and then you walk through and look

1106
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:22,730



1107
00:25:22,730 --> 00:25:25,360
always above you always above

1108
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:25,370



1109
00:25:25,370 --> 00:25:28,270
your movement path this is this

1110
00:25:28,270 --> 00:25:28,280



1111
00:25:28,280 --> 00:25:30,460
composition you look at what

1112
00:25:30,460 --> 00:25:30,470



1113
00:25:30,470 --> 00:25:32,770
the values of the surroundings are of the function

1114
00:25:32,770 --> 00:25:32,780



1115
00:25:32,780 --> 00:25:35,590
but only along your curve and then

1116
00:25:35,590 --> 00:25:35,600



1117
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:37,300
you look the trees are five

1118
00:25:37,300 --> 00:25:37,310



1119
00:25:37,310 --> 00:25:40,330
meters tall two meters tall two and a half four

1120
00:25:40,330 --> 00:25:40,340



1121
00:25:40,340 --> 00:25:42,100
and you ask yourself when I walk along

1122
00:25:42,100 --> 00:25:42,110



1123
00:25:42,110 --> 00:25:44,530
like this how does the height of the trees change

1124
00:25:44,530 --> 00:25:44,540



1125
00:25:44,540 --> 00:25:45,610
that I see there

1126
00:25:45,610 --> 00:25:45,620



1127
00:25:45,620 --> 00:25:48,130
and if you walk the same path

1128
00:25:48,130 --> 00:25:48,140



1129
00:25:48,140 --> 00:25:49,540
but go through faster that is

1130
00:25:49,540 --> 00:25:49,550



1131
00:25:49,550 --> 00:25:51,190
actually a different curve but let's say

1132
00:25:51,190 --> 00:25:51,200



1133
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:52,570
the same path but faster

1134
00:25:52,570 --> 00:25:52,580



1135
00:25:52,580 --> 00:25:54,190
then it will also change faster

1136
00:25:54,190 --> 00:25:54,200



1137
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:55,540
and now you are at some

1138
00:25:55,540 --> 00:25:55,550



1139
00:25:55,550 --> 00:25:58,000
parameter value lambda zero David your alarm rings

1140
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:58,010



1141
00:25:58,010 --> 00:25:59,800
you check what is right now

1142
00:25:59,800 --> 00:25:59,810



1143
00:25:59,810 --> 00:26:02,380
the rate of change of tree height

1144
00:26:02,380 --> 00:26:02,390



1145
00:26:02,390 --> 00:26:03,780
where I am

1146
00:26:03,780 --> 00:26:03,790



1147
00:26:03,790 --> 00:26:05,770
of course you don't look above you

1148
00:26:05,770 --> 00:26:05,780



1149
00:26:05,780 --> 00:26:07,150
and out the window but you

1150
00:26:07,150 --> 00:26:07,160



1151
00:26:07,160 --> 00:26:09,610
understand already so and this is what

1152
00:26:09,610 --> 00:26:09,620



1153
00:26:09,620 --> 00:26:12,400
a this is the directional derivative of

1154
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:12,410



1155
00:26:12,410 --> 00:26:13,960
when you walk in the direction you are

1156
00:26:13,960 --> 00:26:13,970



1157
00:26:13,970 --> 00:26:15,280
yes something different than when you from the same

1158
00:26:15,280 --> 00:26:15,290



1159
00:26:15,290 --> 00:26:16,630
point walk in a different direction

1160
00:26:16,630 --> 00:26:16,640



1161
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:21,340
would yes and this encodes this idea of

1162
00:26:21,340 --> 00:26:21,350



1163
00:26:21,350 --> 00:26:23,860
directional derivative along a curve

1164
00:26:23,860 --> 00:26:23,870



1165
00:26:23,870 --> 00:26:25,920
at a point p

1166
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:25,930



1167
00:26:25,930 --> 00:26:28,870
so as I said before we now

1168
00:26:28,870 --> 00:26:28,880



1169
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:31,630
deal with these formal properties of

1170
00:26:31,630 --> 00:26:31,640



1171
00:26:31,640 --> 00:26:34,210
this object I would like to

1172
00:26:34,210 --> 00:26:34,220



1173
00:26:34,220 --> 00:26:42,940
yes okay make the following remark

1174
00:26:55,180 --> NaN:NaN:NaN,NaN



1175
00:26:55,190 --> 00:26:56,230
and it is again such a

1176
00:26:56,230 --> 00:26:56,240



1177
00:26:56,240 --> 00:27:00,460
terminological remark there is nothing

1178
00:27:00,460 --> 00:27:00,470



1179
00:27:00,470 --> 00:27:03,160
in it but you need to know it

1180
00:27:03,160 --> 00:27:03,170



1181
00:27:03,170 --> 00:27:11,980
terminology one calls X subscript p

1182
00:27:12,420 --> NaN:NaN:NaN,NaN



1183
00:27:12,430 --> 00:27:15,310
so this mapping one calls this

1184
00:27:15,310 --> 00:27:15,320



1185
00:27:15,320 --> 00:27:22,710
mapping X subscript gamma also the

1186
00:27:22,710 --> 00:27:22,720



1187
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:27,100
tangent vector the tangent

1188
00:27:27,100 --> 00:27:27,110



1189
00:27:27,110 --> 00:27:36,130
vector to the curve gamma at point p I

1190
00:27:36,130 --> 00:27:36,140



1191
00:27:36,140 --> 00:27:39,040
emphasize at the traversed point you

1192
00:27:39,040 --> 00:27:39,050



1193
00:27:39,050 --> 00:27:40,530
can of course do more

1194
00:27:40,530 --> 00:27:40,540



1195
00:27:40,540 --> 00:27:42,640
with a point that the curve also

1196
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:42,650



1197
00:27:42,650 --> 00:27:47,140
passes through at the traversed point p and

1198
00:27:47,140 --> 00:27:47,150



1199
00:27:47,150 --> 00:27:49,810
this is the full name of this object

1200
00:27:49,810 --> 00:27:49,820



1201
00:27:49,820 --> 00:27:54,130
and when you think vector think always

1202
00:27:54,130 --> 00:27:54,140



1203
00:27:54,140 --> 00:27:56,260
arrow but from now on with

1204
00:27:56,260 --> 00:27:56,270



1205
00:27:56,270 --> 00:27:57,850
vector you must never again think arrows

1206
00:27:57,850 --> 00:27:57,860



1207
00:27:57,860 --> 00:27:59,830
you must always think mapping

1208
00:27:59,830 --> 00:27:59,840



1209
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:02,650
what we call a tangent vector

1210
00:28:02,650 --> 00:28:02,660



1211
00:28:02,660 --> 00:28:05,170
is a mapping what kind of

1212
00:28:05,170 --> 00:28:05,180



1213
00:28:05,180 --> 00:28:07,720
mapping this mapping what is the

1214
00:28:07,720 --> 00:28:07,730



1215
00:28:07,730 --> 00:28:10,360
meaning it is logically seen the

1216
00:28:10,360 --> 00:28:10,370



1217
00:28:10,370 --> 00:28:14,920
directional derivative yes so the directional

1218
00:28:14,920 --> 00:28:14,930



1219
00:28:14,930 --> 00:28:16,750
derivative is called tangent vector but

1220
00:28:16,750 --> 00:28:16,760



1221
00:28:16,760 --> 00:28:18,580
so a tangent vector is exactly

1222
00:28:18,580 --> 00:28:18,590



1223
00:28:18,590 --> 00:28:21,240
that is simply a directional derivative

1224
00:28:21,240 --> 00:28:21,250



1225
00:28:21,250 --> 00:28:23,890
one can formulate it in many ways

1226
00:28:23,890 --> 00:28:23,900



1227
00:28:23,900 --> 00:28:27,250
that are all okay one could also

1228
00:28:27,250 --> 00:28:27,260



1229
00:28:27,260 --> 00:28:29,260
say in the differential geometry that

1230
00:28:29,260 --> 00:28:29,270



1231
00:28:29,270 --> 00:28:32,620
we practice the concept of a

1232
00:28:32,620 --> 00:28:32,630



1233
00:28:32,630 --> 00:28:36,040
vector survives in the form of a directional

1234
00:28:36,040 --> 00:28:36,050



1235
00:28:36,050 --> 00:28:38,770
derivative perhaps you have so far

1236
00:28:38,770 --> 00:28:38,780



1237
00:28:38,780 --> 00:28:40,300
always seen it this way there is derivative

1238
00:28:40,300 --> 00:28:40,310



1239
00:28:40,310 --> 00:28:42,070
in space and there you can somehow

1240
00:28:42,070 --> 00:28:42,080



1241
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:44,110
throw in a direction there you

1242
00:28:44,110 --> 00:28:44,120



1243
00:28:44,120 --> 00:28:45,400
have derivative have directions

1244
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:45,410



1245
00:28:45,410 --> 00:28:46,990
the total concept is directional

1246
00:28:46,990 --> 00:28:47,000



1247
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:49,540
derivative but actually reversed the

1248
00:28:49,540 --> 00:28:49,550



1249
00:28:49,550 --> 00:28:51,310
directional derivative is the elementary

1250
00:28:51,310 --> 00:28:51,320



1251
00:28:51,320 --> 00:28:53,650
concept and the direction is quasi only

1252
00:28:53,650 --> 00:28:53,660



1253
00:28:53,660 --> 00:28:56,290
philosophy that belongs to it but this is

1254
00:28:56,290 --> 00:28:56,300



1255
00:28:56,300 --> 00:28:58,060
the definition okay this is the

1256
00:28:58,060 --> 00:28:58,070



1257
00:28:58,070 --> 00:29:00,610
tangent vector and if you want

1258
00:29:00,610 --> 00:29:00,620



1259
00:29:00,620 --> 00:29:04,210
examples for this then please look

1260
00:29:04,210 --> 00:29:04,220



1261
00:29:04,220 --> 00:29:07,350
at exercise 1 of the new problem sheet

1262
00:29:07,350 --> 00:29:07,360



1263
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:09,850
examples see

1264
00:29:09,850 --> 00:29:09,860



1265
00:29:09,860 --> 00:29:17,390
exercise 1 fourth problem sheet

1266
00:29:25,600 --> NaN:NaN:NaN,NaN



1267
00:29:25,610 --> 00:29:28,720
so we will now ask ourselves you

1268
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:28,730



1269
00:29:28,730 --> 00:29:30,610
naturally yes wait a moment that can't

1270
00:29:30,610 --> 00:29:30,620



1271
00:29:30,620 --> 00:29:32,350
have been completely wrong with the

1272
00:29:32,350 --> 00:29:32,360



1273
00:29:32,360 --> 00:29:34,780
velocity components where do

1274
00:29:34,780 --> 00:29:34,790



1275
00:29:34,790 --> 00:29:36,340
the velocity components come from

1276
00:29:36,340 --> 00:29:36,350



1277
00:29:36,350 --> 00:29:37,539
now that one encountered in school or in the

1278
00:29:37,539 --> 00:29:37,549



1279
00:29:37,549 --> 00:29:39,310
experimental physics lecture

1280
00:29:39,310 --> 00:29:39,320



1281
00:29:39,320 --> 00:29:42,190
answer for that you must choose a

1282
00:29:42,190 --> 00:29:42,200



1283
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:43,780
chart

1284
00:29:43,780 --> 00:29:43,790



1285
00:29:43,790 --> 00:29:46,180
you have not used any chart at all

1286
00:29:46,180 --> 00:29:46,190



1287
00:29:46,190 --> 00:29:48,130
this is a completely in the real world

1288
00:29:48,130 --> 00:29:48,140



1289
00:29:48,140 --> 00:29:50,500
existing definition on the at the

1290
00:29:50,500 --> 00:29:50,510



1291
00:29:50,510 --> 00:29:52,750
level if you choose a chart

1292
00:29:52,750 --> 00:29:52,760



1293
00:29:52,760 --> 00:29:55,390
you can then in the chart determine components

1294
00:29:55,390 --> 00:29:55,400



1295
00:29:55,400 --> 00:29:57,310
but those then depend on the

1296
00:29:57,310 --> 00:29:57,320



1297
00:29:57,320 --> 00:29:59,740
chart we will do that later

1298
00:29:59,740 --> 00:29:59,750



1299
00:29:59,750 --> 00:30:02,020
before we get there I will now

1300
00:30:02,020 --> 00:30:02,030



1301
00:30:02,030 --> 00:30:04,539
first introduce a central concept

1302
00:30:04,539 --> 00:30:04,549



1303
00:30:04,549 --> 00:30:08,789
namely the concept of tangent spaces

1304
00:30:08,789 --> 00:30:08,799



1305
00:30:08,799 --> 00:30:17,080
thirdly tangent spaces and it is

1306
00:30:17,080 --> 00:30:17,090



1307
00:30:17,090 --> 00:30:23,620
again very simple definition the set

1308
00:30:23,620 --> 00:30:23,630



1309
00:30:23,630 --> 00:30:26,320
first again just a set the

1310
00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:26,330



1311
00:30:26,330 --> 00:30:30,460
set with the name T subscript p M is called

1312
00:30:30,460 --> 00:30:30,470



1313
00:30:30,470 --> 00:30:33,880
just so the tangent space to the

1314
00:30:33,880 --> 00:30:33,890



1315
00:30:33,890 --> 00:30:37,570
manifold M at point p okay what

1316
00:30:37,570 --> 00:30:37,580



1317
00:30:37,580 --> 00:30:38,560
should that be

1318
00:30:38,560 --> 00:30:38,570



1319
00:30:38,570 --> 00:30:41,950
as a set this is the collection of all

1320
00:30:41,950 --> 00:30:41,960



1321
00:30:41,960 --> 00:30:45,850
tangent vectors at the point where

1322
00:30:45,850 --> 00:30:45,860



1323
00:30:45,860 --> 00:30:49,630
gamma is any so that means an

1324
00:30:49,630 --> 00:30:49,640



1325
00:30:49,640 --> 00:30:52,210
arbitrary or all any smooth

1326
00:30:52,210 --> 00:30:52,220



1327
00:30:52,220 --> 00:30:58,030
curve through p is

1328
00:30:59,869 --> NaN:NaN:NaN,NaN



1329
00:30:59,879 --> 00:31:01,399
good one can draw a very nice picture of this

1330
00:31:01,399 --> 00:31:01,409



1331
00:31:01,409 --> 00:31:05,149
so the picture from the beginning this

1332
00:31:05,149 --> 00:31:05,159



1333
00:31:05,159 --> 00:31:06,680
morning there is somehow what I there so

1334
00:31:06,680 --> 00:31:06,690



1335
00:31:06,690 --> 00:31:09,559
part of a sphere so and now you want

1336
00:31:09,559 --> 00:31:09,569



1337
00:31:09,569 --> 00:31:12,949
the tangent space let's say at

1338
00:31:12,949 --> 00:31:12,959



1339
00:31:12,959 --> 00:31:14,930
this point to have

1340
00:31:14,930 --> 00:31:14,940



1341
00:31:14,940 --> 00:31:18,619
what is the tangent space good as

1342
00:31:18,619 --> 00:31:18,629



1343
00:31:18,629 --> 00:31:21,709
a set again how constructed are we

1344
00:31:21,709 --> 00:31:21,719



1345
00:31:21,719 --> 00:31:23,899
must through this point first

1346
00:31:23,899 --> 00:31:23,909



1347
00:31:23,909 --> 00:31:26,239
consider some curve gamma and

1348
00:31:26,239 --> 00:31:26,249



1349
00:31:26,249 --> 00:31:27,619
after that another curve still another

1350
00:31:27,619 --> 00:31:27,629



1351
00:31:27,629 --> 00:31:30,979
another that is a curve gamma and this

1352
00:31:30,979 --> 00:31:30,989



1353
00:31:30,989 --> 00:31:33,859
curve gamma now I am so tempted

1354
00:31:33,859 --> 00:31:33,869



1355
00:31:33,869 --> 00:31:35,389
here this vector this tangent

1356
00:31:35,389 --> 00:31:35,399



1357
00:31:35,399 --> 00:31:37,909
vector arrow to draw but I will

1358
00:31:37,909 --> 00:31:37,919



1359
00:31:37,919 --> 00:31:40,339
not do it

1360
00:31:41,259 --> NaN:NaN:NaN,NaN



1361
00:31:41,269 --> 00:31:43,009
now there is here another

1362
00:31:43,009 --> 00:31:43,019



1363
00:31:43,019 --> 00:31:44,779
curve that also runs through this point

1364
00:31:44,779 --> 00:31:44,789



1365
00:31:44,789 --> 00:31:47,479
let's take this curve here also a

1366
00:31:47,479 --> 00:31:47,489



1367
00:31:47,489 --> 00:31:49,129
curve gamma that also runs through this

1368
00:31:49,129 --> 00:31:49,139



1369
00:31:49,139 --> 00:31:50,899
point and I think if I once

1370
00:31:50,899 --> 00:31:50,909



1371
00:31:50,909 --> 00:31:53,539
more then everyone has understood as you

1372
00:31:53,539 --> 00:31:53,549



1373
00:31:53,549 --> 00:31:55,699
consider every curve gamma through this

1374
00:31:55,699 --> 00:31:55,709



1375
00:31:55,709 --> 00:31:58,519
point so also the curve gamma here

1376
00:31:58,519 --> 00:31:58,529



1377
00:31:58,529 --> 00:32:00,199
that now runs in the direction that

1378
00:32:00,199 --> 00:32:00,209



1379
00:32:00,209 --> 00:32:01,399
runs in the direction

1380
00:32:01,399 --> 00:32:01,409



1381
00:32:01,409 --> 00:32:03,919
that runs in the direction runs in the

1382
00:32:03,919 --> 00:32:03,929



1383
00:32:03,929 --> 00:32:06,319
direction you consider all possible

1384
00:32:06,319 --> 00:32:06,329



1385
00:32:06,329 --> 00:32:09,889
curves through the point you consider

1386
00:32:09,889 --> 00:32:09,899



1387
00:32:09,899 --> 00:32:11,299
however also if I already this

1388
00:32:11,299 --> 00:32:11,309



1389
00:32:11,309 --> 00:32:13,099
yellow curve have painted

1390
00:32:13,099 --> 00:32:13,109



1391
00:32:13,109 --> 00:32:15,019
you naturally consider with every

1392
00:32:15,019 --> 00:32:15,029



1393
00:32:15,029 --> 00:32:16,819
possible curve I naturally also mean

1394
00:32:16,819 --> 00:32:16,829



1395
00:32:16,829 --> 00:32:19,459
curves that though here the blue

1396
00:32:19,459 --> 00:32:19,469



1397
00:32:19,469 --> 00:32:22,669
runs exactly the same path as the

1398
00:32:22,669 --> 00:32:22,679



1399
00:32:22,679 --> 00:32:25,329
yellow one but twice as fast

1400
00:32:25,329 --> 00:32:25,339



1401
00:32:25,339 --> 00:32:28,399
okay you can drive exactly the same path

1402
00:32:28,399 --> 00:32:28,409



1403
00:32:28,409 --> 00:32:30,919
but twice as fast that is the

1404
00:32:30,919 --> 00:32:30,929



1405
00:32:30,929 --> 00:32:34,009
foundation of the German auto industry

1406
00:32:35,289 --> NaN:NaN:NaN,NaN



1407
00:32:35,299 --> 00:32:37,849
if we now really talk about

1408
00:32:37,849 --> 00:32:37,859



1409
00:32:37,859 --> 00:32:39,889
velocity that if I

1410
00:32:39,889 --> 00:32:39,899



1411
00:32:39,899 --> 00:32:42,109
now would draw these vectors the

1412
00:32:42,109 --> 00:32:42,119



1413
00:32:42,119 --> 00:32:44,149
tangent vector don't do but don't

1414
00:32:44,149 --> 00:32:44,159



1415
00:32:44,159 --> 00:32:46,609
because the vector is not an arrow at all

1416
00:32:46,609 --> 00:32:46,619



1417
00:32:46,619 --> 00:32:48,829
but if I were to draw here then

1418
00:32:48,829 --> 00:32:48,839



1419
00:32:48,839 --> 00:32:50,869
the arrow of the velocity

1420
00:32:50,869 --> 00:32:50,879



1421
00:32:50,879 --> 00:32:53,239
vector of the yellow curve would be only

1422
00:32:53,239 --> 00:32:53,249



1423
00:32:53,249 --> 00:32:55,159
half as long at this point as the

1424
00:32:55,159 --> 00:32:55,169



1425
00:32:55,169 --> 00:32:57,879
velocity vector of the blue curve

1426
00:32:57,879 --> 00:32:57,889



1427
00:32:57,889 --> 00:33:00,949
okay if you now imagine that you

1428
00:32:00,949 --> 00:33:00,959



1429
00:33:00,959 --> 00:33:03,139
pass through a point here with

1430
00:33:03,139 --> 00:33:03,149



1431
00:33:03,149 --> 00:33:05,899
all curves but each curve also with

1432
00:33:05,899 --> 00:33:05,909



1433
00:33:05,909 --> 00:33:08,569
every velocity then you get

1434
00:33:08,569 --> 00:33:08,579



1435
00:33:08,579 --> 00:33:11,659
in total all tangent vectors at

1436
00:33:11,659 --> 00:33:11,669



1437
00:33:11,669 --> 00:33:13,400
the point and if

1438
00:33:13,400 --> 00:33:13,410



1439
00:33:13,410 --> 00:33:16,280
now I would draw them as arrows which I

1440
00:33:16,280 --> 00:33:16,290



1441
00:33:16,290 --> 00:33:17,780
cannot do because it is not an arrow

1442
00:33:17,780 --> 00:33:17,790



1443
00:33:17,790 --> 00:33:20,300
it is a mapping but if I

1444
00:33:20,300 --> 00:33:20,310



1445
00:33:20,310 --> 00:33:23,150
would draw them as arrows then you would get

1446
00:33:23,150 --> 00:33:23,160



1447
00:33:23,160 --> 00:33:26,060
as endpoint of these arrows the entire

1448
00:33:26,060 --> 00:33:26,070



1449
00:33:26,070 --> 00:33:29,990
tangent plane to this object can

1450
00:33:29,990 --> 00:33:30,000



1451
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:30,890
you imagine that

1452
00:33:30,890 --> 00:33:30,900



1453
00:33:30,900 --> 00:33:32,900
the longer vectors in one direction

1454
00:33:32,900 --> 00:33:32,910



1455
00:33:32,910 --> 00:33:34,460
you get by

1456
00:33:34,460 --> 00:33:34,470



1457
00:33:34,470 --> 00:33:37,070
running through the curves faster and in

1458
00:33:37,070 --> 00:33:37,080



1459
00:33:37,080 --> 00:33:38,240
other directions you get vectors

1460
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:38,250



1461
00:33:38,250 --> 00:33:40,810
by choosing other curves that's clear

1462
00:33:40,810 --> 00:33:40,820



1463
00:33:40,820 --> 00:33:44,210
so and I draw as I said I also know

1464
00:33:44,210 --> 00:33:44,220



1465
00:33:44,220 --> 00:33:45,590
that we are quite tempted now the

1466
00:33:45,590 --> 00:33:45,600



1467
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:47,330
arrows to draw but we don't draw them

1468
00:33:47,330 --> 00:33:47,340



1469
00:33:47,340 --> 00:33:49,430
because it is not this

1470
00:33:49,430 --> 00:33:49,440



1471
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:51,920
extrinsic picture it is this

1472
00:33:51,920 --> 00:33:51,930



1473
00:33:51,930 --> 00:33:54,020
intrinsic we don't need any reference

1474
00:33:54,020 --> 00:33:54,030



1475
00:33:54,030 --> 00:33:56,840
to the surrounding space and the

1476
00:33:56,840 --> 00:33:56,850



1477
00:33:56,850 --> 00:34:00,020
price we pay for the

1478
00:34:00,020 --> 00:34:00,030



1479
00:34:00,030 --> 00:34:02,120
surrounding space not needing to reference

1480
00:34:02,120 --> 00:34:02,130



1481
00:34:02,130 --> 00:34:04,340
is that we no longer talk about

1482
00:34:04,340 --> 00:34:04,350



1483
00:34:04,350 --> 00:34:07,160
vector arrows but understand the vector

1484
00:34:07,160 --> 00:34:07,170



1485
00:34:07,170 --> 00:34:09,020
or the directions as

1486
00:34:09,020 --> 00:34:09,030



1487
00:34:09,030 --> 00:34:12,440
directional derivatives okay I could

1488
00:34:12,440 --> 00:34:12,450



1489
00:34:12,450 --> 00:34:14,030
now so each element in here


1490
00:34:14,030 --> 00:34:14,040



1491
00:34:14,040 --> 00:34:16,220
take and on any function

1492
00:34:16,220 --> 00:34:16,230



1493
00:34:16,230 --> 00:34:18,440
that is defined on here for you

1494
00:34:18,440 --> 00:34:18,450



1495
00:34:18,450 --> 00:34:20,090
again a temperature distribution or so

1496
00:34:20,090 --> 00:34:20,100



1497
00:34:20,100 --> 00:34:23,210
let it act and then it would just

1498
00:34:23,210 --> 00:34:23,220



1499
00:34:23,220 --> 00:34:24,820
act in this form here

1500
00:34:24,820 --> 00:34:24,830



1501
00:34:24,830 --> 00:34:28,010
okay but on every temperature distribution

1502
00:34:28,010 --> 00:34:28,020



1503
00:34:28,020 --> 00:34:29,870
not on a specific one on every one would

1504
00:34:29,870 --> 00:34:29,880



1505
00:34:29,880 --> 00:34:31,909
it act and that defines thereby

1506
00:34:31,909 --> 00:34:31,919



1507
00:34:31,919 --> 00:34:35,840
the mapping we will make more

1508
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:35,850



1509
00:34:35,850 --> 00:34:38,750
remarks about this shortly so now

1510
00:34:38,750 --> 00:34:38,760



1511
00:34:38,760 --> 00:34:40,400
I already have again so suspicious

1512
00:34:40,400 --> 00:34:40,410



1513
00:34:40,410 --> 00:34:43,669
quite questions so far

1514
00:34:54,760 --> NaN:NaN:NaN,NaN



1515
00:34:54,770 --> 00:34:56,840
please that you think three-dimensionally

1516
00:34:56,840 --> 00:34:56,850



1517
00:34:56,850 --> 00:34:59,270
and not

1518
00:35:12,819 --> NaN:NaN:NaN,NaN



1519
00:35:12,829 --> 00:35:15,470
you put a tangent with the infinite

1520
00:35:15,470 --> 00:35:15,480



1521
00:35:15,480 --> 00:35:17,000
velocity is such a thing

1522
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:17,010



1523
00:35:17,010 --> 00:35:20,710
because then somehow here

1524
00:35:20,710 --> 00:35:20,720



1525
00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:22,670
infinity would come out

1526
00:35:22,670 --> 00:35:22,680



1527
00:35:22,680 --> 00:35:24,319
and there was not only continuous

1528
00:35:24,319 --> 00:35:24,329



1529
00:35:24,329 --> 00:35:25,910
differentiated but with great

1530
00:35:25,910 --> 00:35:25,920



1531
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:28,160
velocity

1532
00:35:29,319 --> NaN:NaN:NaN,NaN



1533
00:35:29,329 --> 00:35:39,079
pardon what the sphere think you don't

1534
00:35:39,079 --> 00:35:39,089



1535
00:35:39,089 --> 00:35:41,870
so if I now ask you abstractly

1536
00:35:41,870 --> 00:35:41,880



1537
00:35:41,880 --> 00:35:43,099
at this point in space because it

1538
00:35:43,099 --> 00:35:43,109



1539
00:35:43,109 --> 00:35:44,920
is my fingertip which

1540
00:35:44,920 --> 00:35:44,930



1541
00:35:44,930 --> 00:35:47,240
velocities are there that means

1542
00:35:47,240 --> 00:35:47,250



1543
00:35:47,250 --> 00:35:48,559
someone once velocity is a

1544
00:35:48,559 --> 00:35:48,569



1545
00:35:48,569 --> 00:35:50,030
property of a curve right

1546
00:35:50,030 --> 00:35:50,040



1547
00:35:50,040 --> 00:35:52,400
and yes it is all the velocities

1548
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:52,410



1549
00:35:52,410 --> 00:35:54,200
that you can realize through curves through this point

1550
00:35:54,200 --> 00:35:54,210



1551
00:35:54,210 --> 00:35:55,670
so one flies through with his rocket

1552
00:35:55,670 --> 00:35:55,680



1553
00:35:55,680 --> 00:35:57,500
cleverly another with his rocket through the

1554
00:35:57,500 --> 00:35:57,510



1555
00:35:57,510 --> 00:35:58,940
other flies like this through and the

1556
00:35:58,940 --> 00:35:58,950



1557
00:35:58,950 --> 00:36:00,890
totality of all these velocities

1558
00:36:00,890 --> 00:36:00,900



1559
00:36:00,900 --> 00:36:03,079

1560
00:36:03,079 --> 00:36:03,089



1561
00:36:03,089 --> 00:36:06,770
yes physically thought that is the

1562
00:36:06,770 --> 00:36:06,780



1563
00:36:06,780 --> 00:36:09,920
tangent space but technically thought

1564
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:09,930



1565
00:36:09,930 --> 00:36:12,530
are the directional derivatives along

1566
00:36:12,530 --> 00:36:12,540



1567
00:36:12,540 --> 00:36:14,480
these curves acting and on arbitrary

1568
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:14,490



1569
00:36:14,490 --> 00:36:16,640
functions

1570
00:36:17,710 --> NaN:NaN:NaN,NaN



1571
00:36:17,720 --> 00:36:22,940
ok so it is okay okay we have here

1572
00:36:22,940 --> 00:36:22,950



1573
00:36:22,950 --> 00:36:26,030
everything okay from so the intuition that

1574
00:36:26,030 --> 00:36:26,040



1575
00:36:26,040 --> 00:36:27,380
I go to I believe that everything that

1576
00:36:27,380 --> 00:36:27,390



1577
00:36:27,390 --> 00:36:28,849
I said is correct and

1578
00:36:28,849 --> 00:36:28,859



1579
00:36:28,859 --> 00:36:29,960
actually cannot be misinterpreted

1580
00:36:29,960 --> 00:36:29,970



1581
00:36:29,970 --> 00:36:32,000
but as is always the case

1582
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:32,010



1583
00:36:32,010 --> 00:36:34,220
all my words are of course only

1584
00:36:34,220 --> 00:36:34,230



1585
00:34:34,230 --> 00:36:35,299
nice talk

1586
00:36:35,299 --> 00:36:35,309



1587
00:36:35,309 --> 00:36:38,059
this is a tangent vector this

1588
00:36:38,059 --> 00:36:38,069



1589
00:36:38,069 --> 00:36:40,099
mapping period you will get used to

1590
00:36:40,099 --> 00:36:40,109



1591
00:36:40,109 --> 00:36:40,640
it

1592
00:36:40,640 --> 00:36:40,650



1593
00:36:40,650 --> 00:36:43,010
ok and you will also see as soon as we

1594
00:36:43,010 --> 00:36:43,020



1595
00:36:43,020 --> 00:36:44,510
have charts we get to that shortly

1596
00:36:44,510 --> 00:36:44,520



1597
00:36:44,520 --> 00:36:46,819
you will say oh I see and hopefully not if

1598
00:36:46,819 --> 00:36:46,829



1599
00:36:46,829 --> 00:36:48,980
yes then you understand me completely a

1600
00:36:48,980 --> 00:36:48,990



1601
00:36:48,990 --> 00:36:51,020
a whole lot but okay let's continue at

1602
00:36:51,020 --> 00:36:51,030



1603
00:36:51,030 --> 00:36:52,220
this point excuse me

1604
00:36:52,220 --> 00:36:52,230



1605
00:36:52,230 --> 00:36:54,289
I don't think you are quite satisfied

1606
00:36:54,289 --> 00:36:54,299



1607
00:36:54,299 --> 00:36:58,700
but comes later good so now I have

1608
00:36:58,700 --> 00:36:58,710



1609
00:36:58,710 --> 00:37:00,650
here again so quite suspiciously

1610
00:37:00,650 --> 00:37:00,660



1611
00:37:00,660 --> 00:37:03,650
written tangent space that is so

1612
00:37:03,650 --> 00:37:03,660



1613
00:37:03,660 --> 00:37:06,859
a set and since in theory

1614
00:37:06,859 --> 00:37:06,869



1615
00:37:06,869 --> 00:37:09,079
structure fanatics are we distinguish

1616
00:37:09,079 --> 00:37:09,089



1617
00:37:09,089 --> 00:37:11,150
this now first the collection of all

1618
00:37:11,150 --> 00:37:11,160



1619
00:37:11,160 --> 00:37:14,359
these tangent vectors at a

1620
00:37:14,359 --> 00:37:14,369



1621
00:37:14,369 --> 00:37:16,849
point not vector here and vector there

1622
00:37:16,849 --> 00:37:16,859



1623
00:37:16,859 --> 00:37:19,010
you see this is for example such a

1624
00:37:19,010 --> 00:37:19,020



1625
00:37:19,020 --> 00:37:19,520
thing

1626
00:37:19,520 --> 00:37:19,530



1627
00:37:19,530 --> 00:37:23,030
our vectors here they all live they

1628
00:37:23,030 --> 00:37:23,040



1629
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:26,120
all have at point p if we from the

1630
00:37:26,120 --> 00:37:26,130



1631
00:37:26,130 --> 00:37:27,920
vectors with another at point

1632
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:27,930



1633
00:37:27,930 --> 00:37:30,230
talk that is a completely different set with

1634
00:37:30,230 --> 00:37:30,240



1635
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:32,059
which we initially have nothing to do at all

1636
00:37:32,059 --> 00:37:32,069



1637
00:37:32,069 --> 00:37:35,809
ok first one point so and now is

1638
00:37:35,809 --> 00:37:35,819



1639
00:37:35,819 --> 00:37:37,990
the question can I actually two

1640
00:37:37,990 --> 00:37:38,000



1641
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:41,150
tangent vectors that these mappings

1642
00:37:41,150 --> 00:37:41,160



1643
00:37:41,160 --> 00:37:43,099
are can I actually add them

1644
00:37:43,099 --> 00:37:43,109



1645
00:37:43,109 --> 00:37:46,490
and the answer is yes I can

1646
00:37:46,490 --> 00:37:46,500



1647
00:37:46,500 --> 00:37:49,220
I now do the following I

1648
00:37:49,220 --> 00:37:49,230



1649
00:37:49,230 --> 00:37:53,500
now define an addition that is called

1650
00:37:53,500 --> 00:37:53,510



1651
00:37:53,510 --> 00:37:58,160
T subscript p plus and T subscript p plus takes

1652
00:37:58,160 --> 00:37:58,170



1653
00:37:58,170 --> 00:38:04,010
now two tangent vectors at p and

1654
00:38:04,010 --> 00:38:04,020



1655
00:38:04,020 --> 00:38:06,559
makes from them a new tangent

1656
00:38:06,559 --> 00:38:06,569



1657
00:38:06,569 --> 00:38:09,859
vector at point p how does it do that

1658
00:38:09,859 --> 00:38:09,869



1659
00:38:09,869 --> 00:38:11,599
actually I just need to tell you it

1660
00:38:11,599 --> 00:38:11,609



1661
00:36:11,609 --> 00:38:15,140
does that pointwise I tell you

1662
00:38:15,140 --> 00:38:15,150



1663
00:38:15,150 --> 00:38:16,700
it does that only pointwise and what do you

1664
00:38:16,700 --> 00:38:16,710



1665
00:38:16,710 --> 00:38:19,549
tell me then then you tell me aha then

1666
00:38:19,549 --> 00:38:19,559



1667
00:38:19,559 --> 00:38:22,220
you take such an X and then

1668
00:38:22,220 --> 00:38:22,230



1669
00:38:22,230 --> 00:38:24,309
you take such a Y

1670
00:38:24,309 --> 00:38:24,319



1671
00:38:24,319 --> 00:38:26,809
these are elements in here good you

1672
00:38:26,809 --> 00:38:26,819



1673
00:38:26,819 --> 00:38:28,039
can of course say you take an

1674
00:38:28,039 --> 00:38:28,049



1675
00:38:28,049 --> 00:38:31,010
X subscript gamma and a X subscript delta that's what

1676
00:38:31,010 --> 00:38:31,020



1677
00:38:31,020 --> 00:38:32,510
the comrades who live in there are called

1678
00:38:32,510 --> 00:38:32,520



1679
00:38:32,520 --> 00:38:33,970
these are both

1680
00:38:33,970 --> 00:38:33,980



1681
00:38:33,980 --> 00:38:37,560
tangent vectors at this point p ok

1682
00:38:37,560 --> 00:38:37,570



1683
00:38:37,570 --> 00:38:42,190
and you say their sum you want

1684
00:38:42,190 --> 00:38:42,200



1685
00:38:42,200 --> 00:38:43,440
to define now

1686
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:43,450



1687
00:38:43,450 --> 00:38:45,520
now I tell you you do that

1688
00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:45,530



1689
00:38:45,530 --> 00:38:48,520
pointwise that means adding

1690
00:38:48,520 --> 00:38:48,530



1691
00:38:48,530 --> 00:38:50,920
mappings what do you have to do when

1692
00:38:50,920 --> 00:38:50,930



1693
00:38:50,930 --> 00:38:52,630
you want to define a mapping point this

1694
00:38:52,630 --> 00:38:52,640



1695
00:38:52,640 --> 00:38:55,560
operation pointwise

1696
00:38:55,560 --> 00:38:55,570



1697
00:38:55,570 --> 00:39:09,490
what do we then have to say exactly

1698
00:39:09,490 --> 00:39:09,500



1699
00:39:09,500 --> 00:39:11,109
it is great and now only the

1700
00:39:11,109 --> 00:39:11,119



1701
00:39:11,119 --> 00:39:13,540
question what is in this context what I

1702
00:39:13,540 --> 00:39:13,550



1703
00:39:13,550 --> 00:39:19,180
for these mappings one point right

1704
00:39:19,180 --> 00:39:19,190



1705
00:39:19,190 --> 00:39:22,450
perfect yes of course very very good very

1706
00:39:22,450 --> 00:39:22,460



1707
00:39:22,460 --> 00:39:25,210
good that in mappings they eat

1708
00:39:25,210 --> 00:39:25,220



1709
00:39:25,220 --> 00:39:27,130
functions and spit out real numbers

1710
00:39:27,130 --> 00:39:27,140



1711
00:39:27,140 --> 00:39:29,410
very nice on that I can namely


1712
00:39:29,410 --> 00:39:29,420



1713
00:39:29,420 --> 00:39:31,680
add and pointwise means here

1714
00:39:31,680 --> 00:39:31,690



1715
00:39:31,690 --> 00:39:35,280
function-wise okay so this thing

1716
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:35,290



1717
00:39:35,290 --> 00:39:38,200
I throw on a point namely on

1718
00:39:38,200 --> 00:39:38,210



1719
00:39:38,210 --> 00:39:40,060
what they act on that was again

1720
00:39:40,060 --> 00:39:40,070



1721
00:39:40,070 --> 00:39:40,990
a function

1722
00:39:40,990 --> 00:39:41,000



1723
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:42,520
and now I have to construct a real number

1724
00:39:42,520 --> 00:39:42,530



1725
00:39:42,530 --> 00:39:45,720
I do that pointwise

1726
00:39:45,720 --> 00:39:45,730



1727
00:39:45,730 --> 00:39:49,510
X subscript p I first let act on f or

1728
00:39:49,510 --> 00:39:49,520



1729
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:50,680
I've mostly written the bracket

1730
00:39:50,680 --> 00:39:50,690



1731
00:39:50,690 --> 00:39:52,750
it acts directly on f and

1732
00:39:52,750 --> 00:39:52,760



1733
00:39:52,760 --> 00:39:54,730
then comes plus this is a plus the

1734
00:39:54,730 --> 00:39:54,740



1735
00:39:54,740 --> 00:39:56,770
plus on the real numbers since that there

1736
00:39:56,770 --> 00:39:56,780



1737
00:39:56,780 --> 00:39:58,870
is a real number and understand here

1738
00:39:58,870 --> 00:39:58,880



1739
00:39:58,880 --> 00:40:03,340
X subscript delta at p of f acts exactly that

1740
00:40:03,340 --> 00:40:03,350



1741
00:40:03,350 --> 00:40:07,270
is pointwise and exactly so we can

1742
00:40:07,270 --> 00:40:07,280



1743
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:11,109
define here a T subscript p times that should

1744
00:40:11,109 --> 00:40:11,119



1745
00:40:11,119 --> 00:40:13,330
now actually also again be such a

1746
00:40:13,330 --> 00:40:13,340



1747
00:40:13,340 --> 00:40:15,970
scaling so I want here a

1748
00:40:15,970 --> 00:40:15,980



1749
00:40:15,980 --> 00:40:20,470
real number with a vector a

1750
00:40:20,470 --> 00:40:20,480



1751
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:23,380
real number scale and I do

1752
00:40:23,380 --> 00:40:23,390



1753
00:40:23,390 --> 00:40:24,880
that also pointwise I won't write

1754
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:24,890



1755
00:40:24,890 --> 00:40:26,290
that down at all you have already

1756
00:40:26,290 --> 00:40:26,300



1757
00:40:26,300 --> 00:40:27,510
understood that

1758
00:40:27,510 --> 00:40:27,520



1759
00:40:27,520 --> 00:40:32,650
ok pointwise yes and you already suspect

1760
00:40:32,650 --> 00:40:32,660



1761
00:40:32,660 --> 00:40:34,990
where this leads one can now

1762
00:40:34,990 --> 00:40:35,000



1763
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:39,020
again show let's have proposition

1764
00:40:39,020 --> 00:40:39,030



1765
00:40:39,030 --> 00:40:41,960
that if I now at a point

1766
00:40:41,960 --> 00:40:41,970



1767
00:40:41,970 --> 00:40:44,630
take the collection of all directional derivatives

1768
00:40:44,630 --> 00:40:44,640



1769
00:40:44,640 --> 00:40:47,000
which we also call tangent vectors

1770
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:47,010



1771
00:40:47,010 --> 00:40:50,900
and I equip this set

1772
00:40:50,900 --> 00:40:50,910



1773
00:40:50,910 --> 00:40:53,480
with this type of addition and this

1774
00:40:53,480 --> 00:40:53,490



1775
00:40:53,490 --> 00:40:55,490
type of scalar multiplication or

1776
00:40:55,490 --> 00:40:55,500



1777
00:40:55,500 --> 00:40:58,340
scaling then this is again a real

1778
00:40:58,340 --> 00:40:58,350



1779
00:40:58,350 --> 00:41:00,340
a real vector space

1780
00:41:00,340 --> 00:41:00,350



1781
00:41:00,350 --> 00:41:07,940
ok so in any case these

1782
00:41:07,940 --> 00:41:07,950



1783
00:41:07,950 --> 00:41:10,930
directional derivatives form a vector space

1784
00:41:10,930 --> 00:41:10,940



1785
00:41:10,940 --> 00:41:14,570
because with these operations they satisfy

1786
00:41:14,570 --> 00:41:14,580



1787
00:41:14,580 --> 00:41:16,880
the properties of a vector space and

1788
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:16,890



1789
00:41:16,890 --> 00:41:18,740
this thing is called the tangent

1790
00:41:18,740 --> 00:41:18,750



1791
00:41:18,750 --> 00:41:25,420
vector space at point p that is the

1792
00:41:25,420 --> 00:41:25,430



1793
00:41:25,430 --> 00:41:28,240
tangent vector space at point p

1794
00:41:28,240 --> 00:41:28,250



1795
00:41:28,250 --> 00:41:31,420
ok and that means when you in physics

1796
00:41:31,420 --> 00:41:31,430



1797
00:41:31,430 --> 00:41:33,230
add velocities

1798
00:41:33,230 --> 00:41:33,240



1799
00:41:33,240 --> 00:41:35,480
at one at one and the same point

1800
00:41:35,480 --> 00:41:35,490



1801
00:41:35,490 --> 00:41:39,170
of course only then you use this

1802
00:41:39,170 --> 00:41:39,180



1803
00:41:39,180 --> 00:41:43,010
box plus function the vector addition

1804
00:41:43,010 --> 00:41:43,020



1805
00:41:43,020 --> 00:41:45,950
of vectors at the same point is

1806
00:41:45,950 --> 00:41:45,960



1807
00:41:45,960 --> 00:41:52,610
this box plus that is it okay here

1808
00:41:52,610 --> 00:41:52,620



1809
00:41:52,620 --> 00:41:53,810
we will of course also again leave out

1810
00:41:53,810 --> 00:41:53,820



1811
00:41:53,820 --> 00:41:56,300
the box in future that is now only

1812
00:41:56,300 --> 00:41:56,310



1813
00:41:56,310 --> 00:41:57,830
to make clear this is not the

1814
00:41:57,830 --> 00:41:57,840



1815
00:41:57,840 --> 00:41:59,780
plus on this but through this plus

1816
00:41:59,780 --> 00:41:59,790



1817
00:41:59,790 --> 00:42:02,590
on R ultimately often on this plus on

1818
00:42:02,590 --> 00:42:02,600



1819
00:42:02,600 --> 00:42:12,920
reduced questions so far so you

1820
00:42:12,920 --> 00:42:12,930



1821
00:42:12,930 --> 00:42:14,480
will the deeper meaning of this

1822
00:42:14,480 --> 00:42:14,490



1823
00:42:14,490 --> 00:42:17,180
abstraction that was made here

1824
00:42:17,180 --> 00:42:17,190



1825
00:42:17,190 --> 00:42:18,530
immediately recognize

1826
00:42:18,530 --> 00:42:18,540



1827
00:42:18,540 --> 00:42:20,660
so until now it is quite abstract

1828
00:42:20,660 --> 00:42:20,670



1829
00:42:20,670 --> 00:42:22,850
and probably quite different from

1830
00:42:22,850 --> 00:42:22,860



1831
00:42:22,860 --> 00:42:24,350
everything you about velocity

1832
00:42:24,350 --> 00:42:24,360



1833
00:42:24,360 --> 00:42:26,510
thought besides said in

1834
00:42:26,510 --> 00:42:26,520



1835
00:42:26,520 --> 00:42:29,320
childhood but you have forgotten that

1836
00:42:29,320 --> 00:42:29,330



1837
00:42:29,330 --> 00:42:33,050
now we make the contact with what

1838
00:42:33,050 --> 00:42:33,060



1839
00:42:33,060 --> 00:42:34,850
you know about velocities or

1840
00:42:34,850 --> 00:42:34,860



1841
00:42:34,860 --> 00:42:37,040
believe to know namely that when you

1842
00:42:37,040 --> 00:42:37,050



1843
00:42:37,050 --> 00:42:39,500
are in a certain chart that you

1844
00:42:39,500 --> 00:42:39,510



1845
00:42:39,510 --> 00:42:41,270
can understand the velocity

1846
00:42:41,270 --> 00:42:41,280



1847
00:42:41,280 --> 00:42:44,210
as a collection of components

1848
00:42:44,210 --> 00:42:44,220



1849
00:42:44,220 --> 00:42:46,340
of this velocity yes that would then be

1850
00:42:46,340 --> 00:42:46,350



1851
00:42:46,350 --> 00:42:48,920
the tuple of the velocities

1852
00:42:48,920 --> 00:42:48,930



1853
00:42:48,930 --> 00:42:51,890
x y z direction or something like that but what we

1854
00:42:51,890 --> 00:42:51,900



1855
00:42:51,900 --> 00:42:52,510
do for that

1856
00:42:52,510 --> 00:42:52,520



1857
00:42:52,520 --> 00:42:55,120
it is to introduce a chart that is the

1858
00:42:55,120 --> 00:42:55,130



1859
00:42:55,130 --> 00:42:57,520
next step

1860
00:43:17,430 --> NaN:NaN:NaN,NaN



1861
00:43:17,440 --> 00:43:27,010
fourth is situation considered on chart

1862
00:43:27,010 --> 00:43:27,020



1863
00:43:27,020 --> 00:43:29,530
level

1864
00:43:34,019 --> NaN:NaN:NaN,NaN



1865
00:43:34,029 --> 00:43:38,430
so good how do we do that now

1866
00:43:38,430 --> 00:43:38,440



1867
00:43:38,440 --> 00:43:40,660
we just write down what

1868
00:43:40,660 --> 00:43:40,670



1869
00:43:40,670 --> 00:43:45,910
we have so we want this object

1870
00:43:45,910 --> 00:43:45,920



1871
00:43:45,920 --> 00:43:49,029
X subscript p this directional derivative along

1872
00:43:49,029 --> 00:43:49,039



1873
00:43:49,039 --> 00:43:50,920
gamma at p or called the

1874
00:43:50,920 --> 00:43:50,930



1875
00:43:50,930 --> 00:43:55,059
tangent vector to gamma at p on

1876
00:43:55,059 --> 00:43:55,069



1877
00:43:55,069 --> 00:44:04,690
chart level understand yes good if one

1878
00:44:04,690 --> 00:44:04,700



1879
00:44:04,700 --> 00:44:06,069
first make clear what are the

1880
00:44:06,069 --> 00:44:06,079



1881
00:44:06,079 --> 00:44:10,329
abstract ingredients the ingredients are

1882
00:44:10,329 --> 00:44:10,339



1883
00:44:10,339 --> 00:44:12,339
first of all a curve gamma

1884
00:44:12,339 --> 00:44:12,349



1885
00:44:12,349 --> 00:44:18,089
that runs on the manifold okay

1886
00:44:18,089 --> 00:44:18,099



1887
00:44:18,099 --> 00:44:21,519
and there again a function but it

1888
00:44:21,519 --> 00:44:21,529



1889
00:44:21,529 --> 00:44:22,720
is quite arbitrary so are

1890
00:44:22,720 --> 00:44:22,730



1891
00:44:22,730 --> 00:44:24,370
arbitrary smooth functions on which this

1892
00:44:24,370 --> 00:44:24,380



1893
00:44:24,380 --> 00:44:25,269
can act

1894
00:44:25,269 --> 00:44:25,279



1895
00:44:25,279 --> 00:44:27,630
okay that was this situation but

1896
00:44:27,630 --> 00:44:27,640



1897
00:44:27,640 --> 00:44:30,880
if we now yes still choose a chart

1898
00:44:30,880 --> 00:44:30,890



1899
00:44:30,890 --> 00:44:33,190
we want to consider it in a chart

1900
00:44:33,190 --> 00:44:33,200



1901
00:44:33,200 --> 00:44:36,309
there would be a chart from our

1902
00:44:36,309 --> 00:44:36,319



1903
00:44:36,319 --> 00:44:39,009
nice smooth atlas it is however

1904
00:44:39,009 --> 00:44:39,019



1905
00:44:39,019 --> 00:44:41,109
of course clever if the point at

1906
00:44:41,109 --> 00:44:41,119



1907
00:44:41,119 --> 00:44:43,180
which we want to consider the situation

1908
00:44:43,180 --> 00:44:43,190



1909
00:44:43,190 --> 00:44:46,599
it should of course lie within the chart

1910
00:44:46,599 --> 00:44:46,609



1911
00:44:46,609 --> 00:44:49,390
domain yes makes no sense

1912
00:44:49,390 --> 00:44:49,400



1913
00:44:49,400 --> 00:44:51,460
if we consider that elsewhere so

1914
00:44:51,460 --> 00:44:51,470



1915
00:44:51,470 --> 00:44:54,630
again wildtier manifold

1916
00:44:54,630 --> 00:44:54,640



1917
00:44:54,640 --> 00:45:02,109
curve gun smoke and that here this is

1918
00:45:02,109 --> 00:45:02,119



1919
00:45:02,119 --> 00:45:04,809
now the chart domain and you know

1920
00:45:04,809 --> 00:45:04,819



1921
00:45:04,819 --> 00:45:06,670
that chart domain that can then

1922
00:45:06,670 --> 00:45:06,680



1923
00:45:06,680 --> 00:45:09,870
be mapped into R to the d

1924
00:45:09,870 --> 00:45:09,880



1925
00:45:09,880 --> 00:45:12,069
and there it lies then now somehow there

1926
00:45:12,069 --> 00:45:12,079



1927
00:45:12,079 --> 00:45:13,319
as x of u

1928
00:45:13,319 --> 00:45:13,329



1929
00:45:13,329 --> 00:45:16,509
as subset of R to the d and likewise

1930
00:45:16,509 --> 00:45:16,519



1931
00:45:16,519 --> 00:45:19,170
of course the curve point by point

1932
00:45:19,170 --> 00:45:19,180



1933
00:45:19,180 --> 00:45:25,269
is mapped there lies okay the chart there


1934
00:45:25,269 --> 00:45:25,279



1935
00:45:25,279 --> 00:45:27,160
I of course only consider here

1936
00:45:27,160 --> 00:45:27,170



1937
00:45:27,170 --> 00:45:30,339
a chart domain in which that lands

1938
00:45:30,339 --> 00:45:30,349



1939
00:45:30,349 --> 00:45:32,559
and you know if that now exactly

1940
00:45:32,559 --> 00:45:32,569



1941
00:45:32,569 --> 00:45:34,210
take we then also have to here

1942
00:45:34,210 --> 00:45:34,220



1943
00:45:34,220 --> 00:45:37,120
restrict the parameter domain that

1944
00:45:37,120 --> 00:45:37,130



1945
00:45:37,130 --> 00:45:40,319
is the preimage with respect to gamma and

1946
00:45:40,319 --> 00:45:40,329



1947
00:45:40,329 --> 00:45:42,789
the restriction of the function u on

1948
00:45:42,789 --> 00:45:42,799



1949
00:45:42,799 --> 00:45:45,039
this domain good given I leave

1950
00:45:45,039 --> 00:45:45,049



1951
00:45:45,049 --> 00:45:45,819
this and

1952
00:45:45,819 --> 00:45:45,829



1953
00:45:45,829 --> 00:45:48,239
must go that is a bit confusing

1954
00:45:48,239 --> 00:45:48,249



1955
00:45:48,249 --> 00:45:51,190
this is the situation so and now you

1956
00:45:51,190 --> 00:45:51,200



1957
00:45:51,200 --> 00:45:52,719
have but and that is of course the trick

1958
00:45:52,719 --> 00:45:52,729



1959
00:45:52,729 --> 00:45:53,769
with the chart

1960
00:45:53,769 --> 00:45:53,779



1961
00:45:53,779 --> 00:45:55,989
you have a chart map x that

1962
00:45:55,989 --> 00:45:55,999



1963
00:45:55,999 --> 00:45:58,390
maps u and then x of u that is

1964
00:45:58,390 --> 00:45:58,400



1965
00:45:58,400 --> 00:46:00,279
a subset of R^d you understand

1966
00:46:00,279 --> 00:46:00,289



1967
00:46:00,289 --> 00:46:02,079
very well and now you can of course

1968
00:46:02,079 --> 00:46:02,089



1969
00:46:02,089 --> 00:46:05,859
here the chart representation of the curve x

1970
00:46:05,859 --> 00:46:05,869



1971
00:46:05,869 --> 00:46:08,440
after gamma indicate and here the

1972
00:46:08,440 --> 00:46:08,450



1973
00:46:08,450 --> 00:46:12,959
chart representation of the function f after x inverse

1974
00:46:12,959 --> 00:46:12,969



1975
00:46:12,969 --> 00:46:18,329
ok course of the ship painted in the atlas

1976
00:46:18,329 --> 00:46:18,339



1977
00:46:18,339 --> 00:46:20,499
temperature distribution of the sea a

1978
00:46:20,499 --> 00:46:20,509



1979
00:46:20,509 --> 00:46:23,249
painted atlas true course of the ship

1980
00:46:23,249 --> 00:46:23,259



1981
00:46:23,259 --> 00:46:26,109
true temperature distribution each in the

1982
00:46:26,109 --> 00:46:26,119



1983
00:46:26,119 --> 00:46:30,219
world okay that is here the question

1984
00:46:32,339 --> NaN:NaN:NaN,NaN



1985
00:46:32,349 --> 00:46:34,900
that is this logic these are our

1986
00:46:34,900 --> 00:46:34,910



1987
00:46:34,910 --> 00:46:38,170
ingredients and now we want this

1988
00:46:38,170 --> 00:46:38,180



1989
00:46:38,180 --> 00:46:41,499
comrade to understand with respect to these

1990
00:46:41,499 --> 00:46:41,509



1991
00:46:41,509 --> 00:46:47,349
ingredients and I think I could use

1992
00:46:47,349 --> 00:46:47,359



1993
00:46:47,359 --> 00:46:49,989
a new board

1994
00:46:57,430 --> NaN:NaN:NaN,NaN



1995
00:46:57,440 --> 00:47:00,609
well we can start here and we

1996
00:47:00,609 --> 00:47:00,619



1997
00:47:00,619 --> 00:47:02,640
let's start here on the left

1998
00:47:02,640 --> 00:47:02,650



1999
00:47:02,650 --> 00:47:04,990
so how do I do that now yes quite

2000
00:47:04,990 --> 00:47:05,000



2001
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:08,170
simple the simplest calculations or

2002
00:47:08,170 --> 00:47:08,180



2003
00:47:08,180 --> 00:47:10,390
almost all calculations that is a tip

2004
00:47:10,390 --> 00:47:10,400



2005
00:47:10,400 --> 00:47:12,339
you can do by starting at the front

2006
00:47:12,339 --> 00:47:12,349



2007
00:47:12,349 --> 00:47:13,660
writing lots of equal signs

2008
00:47:13,660 --> 00:47:13,670



2009
00:47:13,670 --> 00:47:17,710
yes so I want what do I

2010
00:47:17,710 --> 00:47:17,720



2011
00:47:17,720 --> 00:47:19,809
want to understand I want the object X subscript gamma

2012
00:47:19,809 --> 00:47:19,819



2013
00:47:19,819 --> 00:47:23,500
to get to know better

2014
00:47:23,500 --> 00:47:23,510



2015
00:47:23,510 --> 00:47:26,109
so I take it and what do I

2016
00:47:26,109 --> 00:47:26,119



2017
00:47:26,119 --> 00:47:28,540
do with it yes good what can I do

2018
00:47:28,540 --> 00:47:28,550



2019
00:47:28,550 --> 00:47:30,069
first of all nothing what is the

2020
00:47:30,069 --> 00:47:30,079



2021
00:47:30,079 --> 00:47:31,540
definition I learn it better

2022
00:47:31,540 --> 00:47:31,550



2023
00:47:31,550 --> 00:47:33,220
when I let it act on an arbitrary

2024
00:47:33,220 --> 00:47:33,230



2025
00:47:33,230 --> 00:47:36,609
function f why do I learn

2026
00:47:36,609 --> 00:47:36,619



2027
00:47:36,619 --> 00:47:38,589
it better then then I have by

2028
00:47:38,589 --> 00:47:38,599



2029
00:47:38,599 --> 00:47:42,550
definition I know this is f after

2030
00:47:42,550 --> 00:47:42,560



2031
00:47:42,560 --> 00:47:45,309
gamma I look at how the temperature

2032
00:47:45,309 --> 00:47:45,319



2033
00:47:45,319 --> 00:47:46,839
changes when I along the curve gamma

2034
00:47:46,839 --> 00:47:46,849



2035
00:47:46,849 --> 00:47:48,700
walk along how it changes I must

2036
00:47:48,700 --> 00:47:48,710



2037
00:47:48,710 --> 00:47:51,040
differentiate the result that is only

2038
00:47:51,040 --> 00:47:51,050



2039
00:47:51,050 --> 00:47:55,660
still a function of R and that I

2040
00:47:55,660 --> 00:47:55,670



2041
00:47:55,670 --> 00:47:58,089
differentiate at the position lambda zero

2042
00:47:58,089 --> 00:47:58,099



2043
00:47:58,099 --> 00:47:59,859
yes if I write lambda zero here

2044
00:47:59,859 --> 00:47:59,869



2045
00:47:59,869 --> 00:48:01,750
then I must have made clear to myself before

2046
00:48:01,750 --> 00:48:01,760



2047
00:48:01,760 --> 00:48:04,150
then must this lambda zero the

2048
00:48:04,150 --> 00:48:04,160



2049
00:48:04,160 --> 00:48:07,059
must be the parameter value at which

2050
00:48:07,059 --> 00:48:07,069



2051
00:48:07,069 --> 00:48:08,950
the curve passes by this point p

2052
00:48:08,950 --> 00:48:08,960



2053
00:48:08,960 --> 00:48:11,349
I must always insert the appropriate

2054
00:48:11,349 --> 00:48:11,359



2055
00:48:11,359 --> 00:48:13,200
parameter value

2056
00:48:13,200 --> 00:48:13,210



2057
00:48:13,210 --> 00:48:16,930
good is the definition this is our

2058
00:48:16,930 --> 00:48:16,940



2059
00:48:16,940 --> 00:48:19,390
first acquaintance with the object how

2060
00:48:19,390 --> 00:48:19,400



2061
00:48:19,400 --> 00:48:20,680
do I now make closer acquaintance

2062
00:48:20,680 --> 00:48:20,690



2063
00:48:20,690 --> 00:48:23,290
again two ways I can either

2064
00:48:23,290 --> 00:48:23,300



2065
00:48:23,300 --> 00:48:26,559
look at this picture and see f after

2066
00:48:26,559 --> 00:48:26,569



2067
00:48:26,569 --> 00:48:29,890
gamma that is this path here first

2068
00:48:29,890 --> 00:48:29,900



2069
00:48:29,900 --> 00:48:33,099
then f after made that is this path

2070
00:48:33,099 --> 00:48:33,109



2071
00:48:33,109 --> 00:48:35,890
I could of course go this path

2072
00:48:35,890 --> 00:48:35,900



2073
00:48:35,900 --> 00:48:38,589
just as well and would also reach the goal that is

2074
00:48:38,589 --> 00:48:38,599



2075
00:48:38,599 --> 00:48:40,150
the graphical argumentation

2076
00:48:40,150 --> 00:48:40,160



2077
00:48:40,160 --> 00:48:41,620
I can also argue algebraically

2078
00:48:41,620 --> 00:48:41,630



2079
00:48:41,630 --> 00:48:43,030
I say there stands first

2080
00:48:43,030 --> 00:48:43,040



2081
00:48:43,040 --> 00:48:46,030
after gamma there in parentheses prime of

2082
00:48:46,030 --> 00:48:46,040



2083
00:48:46,040 --> 00:48:52,210
lambda zero good there stands also f after x inverse

2084
00:48:52,210 --> 00:48:52,220



2085
00:48:52,220 --> 00:48:54,819
after x after gamma that is first

2086
00:48:54,819 --> 00:48:54,829



2087
00:48:54,829 --> 00:48:56,710
bracketed like this that is simply just the

2088
00:48:56,710 --> 00:48:56,720



2089
00:48:56,720 --> 00:48:59,770
identity inserted nothing happens there

2090
00:48:59,770 --> 00:48:59,780



2091
00:48:59,780 --> 00:49:02,470
but because the composition

2092
00:49:02,470 --> 00:49:02,480



2093
00:49:02,480 --> 00:49:05,349
this circle because it is associative it is

2094
00:49:05,349 --> 00:49:05,359



2095
00:49:05,359 --> 00:49:07,359
of course the same as f after x

2096
00:49:07,359 --> 00:49:07,369



2097
00:49:07,369 --> 00:49:11,020
inverse bracketed after

2098
00:49:11,020 --> 00:49:11,030



2099
00:49:11,030 --> 00:49:14,800
gamma done differentiate at the position at

2100
00:49:14,800 --> 00:49:14,810



2101
00:49:14,810 --> 00:49:16,290
lambda zero

2102
00:49:16,290 --> 00:49:16,300



2103
00:49:16,300 --> 00:49:19,540
of course that is of course f x inverse

2104
00:49:19,540 --> 00:49:19,550



2105
00:49:19,550 --> 00:49:22,540
after x after gamma clear what we here

2106
00:49:22,540 --> 00:49:22,550



2107
00:49:22,550 --> 00:49:24,520
in the picture in the diagram read must

2108
00:49:24,520 --> 00:49:24,530



2109
00:49:24,530 --> 00:49:26,050
of course also algebraically to

2110
00:49:26,050 --> 00:49:26,060



2111
00:49:26,060 --> 00:49:29,170
justify it there stands so what until

2112
00:49:29,170 --> 00:49:29,180



2113
00:49:29,180 --> 00:49:30,370
now happens nothing at all

2114
00:49:30,370 --> 00:49:30,380



2115
00:49:30,380 --> 00:49:35,320
yes we massage the definition yes good

2116
00:49:35,320 --> 00:49:35,330



2117
00:49:35,330 --> 00:49:36,850
that we made more complicated how

2118
00:49:36,850 --> 00:49:36,860



2119
00:49:36,860 --> 00:49:38,230
so we get to know the thing better

2120
00:49:38,230 --> 00:49:38,240



2121
00:49:38,240 --> 00:49:40,960
when it is more complicated well these

2122
00:49:40,960 --> 00:49:40,970



2123
00:49:40,970 --> 00:49:42,970
comrades here I understand them

2124
00:49:42,970 --> 00:49:42,980



2125
00:49:42,980 --> 00:49:44,880
actually quite well

2126
00:49:44,880 --> 00:49:44,890



2127
00:49:44,890 --> 00:49:47,890
and I would like to give them names now

2128
00:49:47,890 --> 00:49:47,900



2129
00:49:47,900 --> 00:49:50,050
respectively that one doesn't need

2130
00:49:50,050 --> 00:49:50,060



2131
00:49:50,060 --> 00:49:52,510
necessarily to give a name but the

2132
00:49:52,510 --> 00:49:52,520



2133
00:49:52,520 --> 00:49:55,030
respective name of the chart representation

2134
00:49:55,030 --> 00:49:55,040



2135
00:49:55,040 --> 00:49:57,490
of the curve or that is the chart

2136
00:49:57,490 --> 00:49:57,500



2137
00:49:57,500 --> 00:49:59,530
representation of the curve and I want to

2138
00:49:59,530 --> 00:49:59,540



2139
00:49:59,540 --> 00:50:01,950
call it small q

2140
00:50:01,950 --> 00:50:01,960



2141
00:50:01,960 --> 00:50:08,050
it is called small q small q what is

2142
00:50:08,050 --> 00:50:08,060



2143
00:50:08,060 --> 00:50:10,030
this for an object this is an object where

2144
00:50:10,030 --> 00:50:10,040



2145
00:50:10,040 --> 00:50:11,170
does it come from

2146
00:50:11,170 --> 00:50:11,180



2147
00:50:11,180 --> 00:50:14,980
this comes from a subset of the

2148
00:50:14,980 --> 00:50:14,990



2149
00:50:14,990 --> 00:50:17,800
real numbers and goes into R to the d

2150
00:50:17,800 --> 00:50:17,810



2151
00:50:17,810 --> 00:50:19,180
so I don't take exactly yet

2152
00:50:19,180 --> 00:50:19,190



2153
00:50:19,190 --> 00:50:21,400
where exactly it comes from the crucial thing is

2154
00:50:21,400 --> 00:50:21,410



2155
00:50:21,410 --> 00:50:23,080
it comes from a subdomain of

2156
00:50:23,080 --> 00:50:23,090



2157
00:50:23,090 --> 00:50:25,650
real numbers and lands in R to the d

2158
00:50:25,650 --> 00:50:25,660



2159
00:50:25,660 --> 00:50:28,180
and this comrade has after x

2160
00:50:28,180 --> 00:50:28,190



2161
00:50:28,190 --> 00:50:30,700
inverse is the chart representation of the

2162
00:50:30,700 --> 00:50:30,710



2163
00:50:30,710 --> 00:50:33,280
function should I call it now

2164
00:50:33,280 --> 00:50:33,290



2165
00:50:33,290 --> 00:50:38,410
f tilde or something anything or whatever

2166
00:50:38,410 --> 00:50:38,420



2167
00:50:38,420 --> 00:50:40,030
f tilde one can do but not so

2168
00:50:40,030 --> 00:50:40,040



2169
00:50:40,040 --> 00:50:41,620
frequently used but the crucial

2170
00:50:41,620 --> 00:50:41,630



2171
00:50:41,630 --> 00:50:45,070
thing is this thing that goes from R^d into

2172
00:50:45,070 --> 00:50:45,080



2173
00:50:45,080 --> 00:50:48,010
the real numbers and clear I can

2174
00:50:48,010 --> 00:50:48,020



2175
00:50:48,020 --> 00:50:49,210
evaluate one after another

2176
00:50:49,210 --> 00:50:49,220



2177
00:50:49,220 --> 00:50:51,370
that means what has remained here

2178
00:50:51,370 --> 00:50:51,380



2179
00:50:51,380 --> 00:50:53,680
this is an advanced course exercise

2180
00:50:53,680 --> 00:50:53,690



2181
00:50:53,690 --> 00:50:56,670
mathematics take or well good

2182
00:50:56,670 --> 00:50:56,680



2183
00:50:56,680 --> 00:50:59,800
introduction course exercise yes mapping from

2184
00:50:59,800 --> 00:50:59,810



2185
00:50:59,810 --> 00:51:02,560
R^d to them R to the d composition

2186
00:51:02,560 --> 00:51:02,570



2187
00:51:02,570 --> 00:51:05,710
and then the derivative of the

2188
00:51:05,710 --> 00:51:05,720



2189
00:51:05,720 --> 00:51:07,900
composition so chain

2190
00:51:07,900 --> 00:51:07,910



2191
00:51:07,910 --> 00:51:10,090
rule right but simply the

2192
00:51:10,090 --> 00:51:10,100



2193
00:51:10,100 --> 00:51:12,730
plain old chain rule and that

2194
00:51:12,730 --> 00:51:12,740



2195
00:51:12,740 --> 00:51:14,050
we now write down and there

2196
00:51:14,050 --> 00:51:14,060



2197
00:51:14,060 --> 00:51:15,430
we have to pay attention a bit with

2198
00:51:15,430 --> 00:51:15,440



2199
00:51:15,440 --> 00:51:17,110
this chain rule you practiced that on

2200
00:51:17,110 --> 00:51:17,120



2201
00:51:17,120 --> 00:51:20,650
the first problem sheet you must there

2202
00:51:20,650 --> 00:51:20,660



2203
00:51:20,660 --> 00:51:23,200
also pay attention what is there the

2204
00:51:23,200 --> 00:51:23,210



2205
00:51:23,210 --> 00:51:24,640
outer derivative that

2206
00:51:24,640 --> 00:51:24,650



2207
00:51:24,650 --> 00:51:27,670
whoever the outer derivative yes outer

2208
00:51:27,670 --> 00:51:27,680



2209
00:51:27,680 --> 00:51:30,400
derivative there you can differentiate in the

2210
00:51:30,400 --> 00:51:30,410



2211
00:51:30,410 --> 00:51:34,900
j direction so the j comes from R^d that

2212
00:51:34,900 --> 00:51:34,910



2213
00:51:34,910 --> 00:51:37,510
has components j equals one to

2214
00:51:37,510 --> 00:51:37,520



2215
00:51:37,520 --> 00:51:39,519
j equals d you differentiate in the j-th

2216
00:51:39,519 --> 00:51:39,529



2217
00:51:39,529 --> 00:51:42,220
direction this object so I

2218
00:51:42,220 --> 00:51:42,230



2219
00:51:42,230 --> 00:51:45,640
write down first after x inverse differentiated

2220
00:51:45,640 --> 00:51:45,650



2221
00:51:45,650 --> 00:51:50,460
in the j-th direction after you

2222
00:51:50,460 --> 00:51:50,470



2223
00:51:50,470 --> 00:51:53,980
have differentiated it actually doesn't need

2224
00:51:53,980 --> 00:51:53,990



2225
00:51:53,990 --> 00:51:55,750
mentioning but we make it

2226
00:51:55,750 --> 00:51:55,760



2227
00:51:55,760 --> 00:51:57,000
quite clear

2228
00:51:57,000 --> 00:51:57,010



2229
00:51:57,010 --> 00:52:01,210
after you have differentiated then you may

2230
00:52:01,210 --> 00:52:01,220



2231
00:52:01,220 --> 00:52:03,250
insert a point where to

2232
00:52:03,250 --> 00:52:03,260



2233
00:52:03,260 --> 00:52:06,250
evaluate which point is that according

2234
00:52:06,250 --> 00:52:06,260



2235
00:52:06,260 --> 00:52:08,710
to chain rule is that this other

2236
00:52:08,710 --> 00:52:08,720



2237
00:52:08,720 --> 00:52:12,730
function here thrown on so x after

2238
00:52:12,730 --> 00:52:12,740



2239
00:52:12,740 --> 00:52:16,690
gamma thrown on lambda zero

2240
00:52:16,690 --> 00:52:16,700



2241
00:52:16,700 --> 00:52:19,930
so it is and how does the chain rule

2242
00:52:19,930 --> 00:52:19,940



2243
00:52:19,940 --> 00:52:20,650
continue

2244
00:52:20,650 --> 00:52:20,660



2245
00:52:20,660 --> 00:52:22,990
well now the chain rule says do

2246
00:52:22,990 --> 00:52:23,000



2247
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:26,230
now the inner derivative that lands

2248
00:52:26,230 --> 00:52:26,240



2249
00:52:26,240 --> 00:52:27,339
but in R^d

2250
00:52:27,339 --> 00:52:27,349



2251
00:52:27,349 --> 00:52:29,410
so it also has different

2252
00:52:29,410 --> 00:52:29,420



2253
00:52:29,420 --> 00:52:32,920
components and these components

2254
00:52:32,920 --> 00:52:32,930



2255
00:52:32,930 --> 00:52:35,079
are all differentiated that says the

2256
00:52:35,079 --> 00:52:35,089



2257
00:52:35,089 --> 00:52:37,990
chain rule and the component as

2258
00:52:37,990 --> 00:52:38,000



2259
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:40,450
is summed with this thing there

2260
00:52:40,450 --> 00:52:40,460



2261
00:52:40,460 --> 00:52:43,390
stands so I here comes first

2262
00:52:43,390 --> 00:52:43,400



2263
00:52:43,400 --> 00:52:45,730
times that times on the real numbers

2264
00:52:45,730 --> 00:52:45,740



2265
00:52:45,740 --> 00:52:48,910
then there stands x after gamma this thing

2266
00:52:48,910 --> 00:52:48,920



2267
00:52:48,920 --> 00:52:53,319
but has a j-th component there stands


2268
00:52:53,319 --> 00:52:53,329



2269
00:52:53,329 --> 00:52:59,109
you and that and this j-th component

2270
00:52:59,109 --> 00:52:59,119



2271
00:52:59,119 --> 00:53:02,049
when I have calculated it it is

2272
00:53:02,049 --> 00:53:02,059



2273
00:53:02,059 --> 00:53:05,319
differentiated that this derivative again

2274
00:53:05,319 --> 00:53:05,329



2275
00:53:05,329 --> 00:53:08,289
it is differentiated and the whole thing is

2276
00:53:08,289 --> 00:53:08,299



2277
00:53:08,299 --> 00:53:11,109
after the differentiation evaluated

2278
00:53:11,109 --> 00:53:11,119



2279
00:53:11,119 --> 00:53:14,049
at point lambda zero

2280
00:53:15,240 --> NaN:NaN:NaN,NaN



2281
00:53:15,250 --> 00:53:18,160
that is the multidimensional chain

2282
00:53:18,160 --> 00:53:18,170



2283
00:53:18,170 --> 00:53:21,880
rule so it just is is not simple

2284
00:53:21,880 --> 00:53:21,890



2285
00:53:21,890 --> 00:53:26,400
ok everything done correctly

2286
00:53:26,400 --> 00:53:26,410



2287
00:53:26,410 --> 00:53:28,049
I hope

2288
00:53:28,049 --> 00:53:28,059



2289
00:53:28,059 --> 00:53:31,799
so now this is of course incredibly

2290
00:53:31,799 --> 00:53:31,809



2291
00:53:31,809 --> 00:53:34,620
ugly what stands there and we transform

2292
00:53:34,620 --> 00:53:34,630



2293
00:53:34,630 --> 00:53:35,759
that now through a small cosmetic

2294
00:53:35,759 --> 00:53:35,769



2295
00:53:35,769 --> 00:53:41,729
operation into something incredibly pretty as

2296
00:53:41,729 --> 00:53:41,739



2297
00:53:41,739 --> 00:53:43,769
first the following that was a

2298
00:53:43,769 --> 00:53:43,779



2299
00:53:43,779 --> 00:53:45,689
multiplication on the reals so

2300
00:53:45,689 --> 00:53:45,699



2301
00:53:45,699 --> 00:53:47,429
this j and this j over it

2302
00:53:47,429 --> 00:53:47,439



2303
00:53:47,439 --> 00:53:49,439
we of course sum according to the sum

2304
00:53:49,439 --> 00:53:49,449



2305
00:53:49,449 --> 00:53:51,959
action convention problem sheet one

2306
00:53:51,959 --> 00:53:51,969



2307
00:53:51,969 --> 00:53:54,150
right there stands a big sum over

2308
00:53:54,150 --> 00:53:54,160



2309
00:53:54,160 --> 00:53:57,319
j j equals one to dimension M over it

2310
00:53:57,319 --> 00:53:57,329



2311
00:53:57,329 --> 00:53:59,789
and that was it but just this times

2312
00:53:59,789 --> 00:53:59,799



2313
00:53:59,799 --> 00:54:00,539
is always only a real

2314
00:54:00,539 --> 00:54:00,549



2315
00:54:00,549 --> 00:54:02,249
multiplication I can so this

2316
00:54:02,249 --> 00:54:02,259



2317
00:54:02,259 --> 00:54:04,439
second factor I can also take

2318
00:54:04,439 --> 00:54:04,449



2319
00:54:04,449 --> 00:54:07,309
to the front so this is x after gamma

2320
00:54:07,309 --> 00:54:07,319



2321
00:54:07,319 --> 00:54:09,420
j-th component

2322
00:54:09,420 --> 00:54:09,430



2323
00:54:09,430 --> 00:54:11,880
but that is the j-th component here

2324
00:54:11,880 --> 00:54:11,890



2325
00:54:11,890 --> 00:54:15,150
outside because I here at the

2326
00:54:15,150 --> 00:54:15,160



2327
00:54:15,160 --> 00:54:18,539
the j-th x j-th component of the

2328
00:54:18,539 --> 00:54:18,549



2329
00:54:18,549 --> 00:54:20,549
coordinate mapping can take can

2330
00:54:20,549 --> 00:54:20,559



2331
00:54:20,559 --> 00:54:23,279
so take the curve and consider what

2332
00:54:23,279 --> 00:54:23,289



2333
00:54:23,289 --> 00:54:26,759
the j-th coordinate of this curve is yes

2334
00:54:26,759 --> 00:54:26,769



2335
00:54:26,769 --> 00:54:29,640
that the chart image of the curve and that

2336
00:54:29,640 --> 00:54:29,650



2337
00:54:29,650 --> 00:54:31,469
I can differentiate that exactly the same

2338
00:54:31,469 --> 00:54:31,479



2339
00:54:31,479 --> 00:54:34,079
as what stood there at the point lambda I

2340
00:54:34,079 --> 00:54:34,089



2341
00:54:34,089 --> 00:54:38,759
have that the j to j becomes I have that

2342
00:54:38,759 --> 00:54:38,769



2343
00:54:38,769 --> 00:54:41,150
the j from here jump here

2344
00:54:41,150 --> 00:54:41,160



2345
00:54:41,160 --> 00:54:44,160
because that is what the j-th component

2346
00:54:44,160 --> 00:54:44,170



2347
00:54:44,170 --> 00:54:46,650
of this mapping is if that

2348
00:54:46,650 --> 00:54:46,660



2349
00:54:46,660 --> 00:54:48,419
is not clear to you mean yourself an image in the

2350
00:54:48,419 --> 00:54:48,429



2351
00:54:48,429 --> 00:54:50,609
diagram is always not clear ask

2352
00:54:50,609 --> 00:54:50,619



2353
00:54:50,619 --> 00:54:53,069
me okay we have this thing now

2354
00:54:53,069 --> 00:54:53,079



2355
00:54:53,079 --> 00:54:55,410
comes this times provocatively law of

2356
00:54:55,410 --> 00:54:55,420



2357
00:54:55,420 --> 00:54:57,329
multiplication that is no problem

2358
00:54:57,329 --> 00:54:57,339



2359
00:54:57,339 --> 00:55:00,390
and this object here we write

2360
00:55:00,390 --> 00:55:00,400



2361
00:55:00,400 --> 00:55:03,089
now a bit prettier x after

2362
00:55:03,089 --> 00:55:03,099



2363
00:55:03,099 --> 00:55:04,739
gamma of lambda zero

2364
00:55:04,739 --> 00:55:04,749



2365
00:55:04,749 --> 00:55:07,469
that is x of gamma of lambda zero but

2366
00:55:07,469 --> 00:55:07,479



2367
00:55:07,479 --> 00:55:09,929
gamma of lambda zero is p that means here

2368
00:55:09,929 --> 00:55:09,939



2369
00:55:09,939 --> 00:55:11,699
that is evaluated and at the point

2370
00:55:11,699 --> 00:55:11,709



2371
00:55:11,709 --> 00:55:15,689
x of p there stands so partial j applied

2372
00:55:15,689 --> 00:55:15,699



2373
00:55:15,699 --> 00:55:19,589
to f after x inverse and evaluated

2374
00:55:19,589 --> 00:55:19,599



2375
00:55:19,599 --> 00:55:20,729
is the whole thing after you have formed the

2376
00:55:20,729 --> 00:55:20,739



2377
00:55:20,739 --> 00:55:23,429
derivative at point x of


2378
00:55:23,429 --> 00:55:23,439



2379
00:55:23,439 --> 00:55:28,049
p so and now I had asked you on the

2380
00:55:28,049 --> 00:55:28,059



2381
00:55:28,059 --> 00:55:32,999
first problem sheet never to

2382
00:55:32,999 --> 00:55:33,009



2383
00:55:33,009 --> 00:55:36,179
write according to x^j according to

2384
00:55:36,179 --> 00:55:36,189



2385
00:55:36,189 --> 00:55:38,189
epsilon j and so on or the after

2386
00:55:38,189 --> 00:55:38,199



2387
00:55:38,199 --> 00:55:40,679
the x-th after the y for these partial

2388
00:55:40,679 --> 00:55:40,689



2389
00:55:40,689 --> 00:55:41,009
de-

2390
00:55:41,009 --> 00:55:41,019



2391
00:55:41,019 --> 00:55:42,809
rivatives and you see I follow my

2392
00:55:42,809 --> 00:55:42,819



2393
00:55:42,819 --> 00:55:45,329
own advice the partial derivative goes

2394
00:55:45,329 --> 00:55:45,339



2395
00:55:45,339 --> 00:55:47,849
with respect to the j-th entry

2396
00:55:47,849 --> 00:55:47,859



2397
00:55:47,859 --> 00:55:51,769
of this function all good but now

2398
00:55:51,769 --> 00:55:51,779



2399
00:55:51,779 --> 00:55:55,679
namely as occasion that yes here this

2400
00:55:55,679 --> 00:55:55,689



2401
00:55:55,689 --> 00:55:56,959
function f is the abstract

2402
00:55:56,959 --> 00:55:56,969



2403
00:55:56,969 --> 00:55:59,819
temperature distribution of the real world but

2404
00:55:59,819 --> 00:55:59,829



2405
00:55:59,829 --> 00:56:02,339
this x is the chart mapping

2406
00:56:02,339 --> 00:56:02,349



2407
00:56:02,349 --> 00:56:04,559
of the special chart that I have

2408
00:56:04,559 --> 00:56:04,569



2409
00:56:04,569 --> 00:56:08,309
chosen and I dare now this

2410
00:56:08,309 --> 00:56:08,319



2411
00:56:08,319 --> 00:56:10,620
whole object here a simpler

2412
00:56:10,620 --> 00:56:10,630



2413
00:56:10,630 --> 00:56:14,069
name to give and this simple name

2414
00:56:14,069 --> 00:56:14,079



2415
00:56:14,079 --> 00:56:16,499
is the following this object is called

2416
00:56:16,499 --> 00:56:16,509



2417
00:56:16,509 --> 00:56:33,989
partial by partial x^j so that is what this

2418
00:56:33,989 --> 00:56:33,999



2419
00:56:33,999 --> 00:56:36,149
thing is called and now why does it make sense to

2420
00:56:36,149 --> 00:56:36,159



2421
00:56:36,159 --> 00:56:39,479
name it so five minutes again why what

2422
00:56:39,479 --> 00:56:39,489



2423
00:56:39,489 --> 00:56:40,739
is the point in naming it so

2424
00:56:40,739 --> 00:56:40,749



2425
00:56:40,749 --> 00:56:43,499
well all the information that is up there

2426
00:56:43,499 --> 00:56:43,509



2427
00:56:43,509 --> 00:56:45,839
is down there when I

2428
00:56:45,839 --> 00:56:45,849



2429
00:56:45,849 --> 00:56:47,549
call such an object there you know how

2430
00:56:47,549 --> 00:56:47,559



2431
00:56:47,559 --> 00:56:49,469
the function is called you know how the

2432
00:56:49,469 --> 00:56:49,479



2433
00:56:49,479 --> 00:56:52,799
chart mapping is called you know in

2434
00:56:52,799 --> 00:56:52,809



2435
00:56:52,809 --> 00:56:55,319
which direction you have to differentiate here

2436
00:56:55,319 --> 00:56:55,329



2437
00:56:55,329 --> 00:56:56,370
you have again the chart

2438
00:56:56,370 --> 00:56:56,380



2439
00:56:56,380 --> 00:56:57,989
mappings you take this p so

2440
00:56:57,989 --> 00:56:57,999



2441
00:56:57,999 --> 00:57:01,079
when you see this object and want

2442
00:57:01,079 --> 00:57:01,089



2443
00:57:01,089 --> 00:57:02,239
to calculate with it

2444
00:57:02,239 --> 00:57:02,249



2445
00:57:02,249 --> 00:57:04,709
then don't fall into the reflex

2446
00:57:04,709 --> 00:57:04,719



2447
00:57:04,719 --> 00:57:06,569
to say it's quite simple I differentiate f

2448
00:57:06,569 --> 00:57:06,579



2449
00:57:06,579 --> 00:57:11,069
after the variable x^j when you see

2450
00:57:11,069 --> 00:57:11,079



2451
00:57:11,079 --> 00:57:13,679
this object replace it first

2452
00:57:13,679 --> 00:57:13,689



2453
00:57:13,689 --> 00:57:16,199
technically thought through and with that you may

2454
00:57:16,199 --> 00:57:16,209



2455
00:57:16,209 --> 00:57:19,769
then calculate according to the rules of

2456
00:57:19,769 --> 00:57:19,779



2457
00:57:19,779 --> 00:57:24,029
differentiation in R^d okay that is

2458
00:57:24,029 --> 00:57:24,039



2459
00:57:24,039 --> 00:57:26,399
a new object that is a new

2460
00:57:26,399 --> 00:57:26,409



2461
00:57:26,409 --> 00:57:33,629
symbol okay so and this symbol is of

2462
00:57:33,629 --> 00:57:33,639



2463
00:57:33,639 --> 00:57:36,649
extraordinary usefulness especially

2464
00:57:36,649 --> 00:57:36,659



2465
00:57:36,659 --> 00:57:39,059
because we this symbol and that here

2466
00:57:39,059 --> 00:57:39,069



2467
00:57:39,069 --> 00:57:41,099
is called so by that I mean exactly

2468
00:57:41,099 --> 00:57:41,109



2469
00:57:41,109 --> 00:57:48,539
the same partial by partial x^j at p when I

2470
00:57:48,539 --> 00:57:48,549



2471
00:57:48,549 --> 00:57:51,059
write the f at the end you have

2472
00:57:51,059 --> 00:57:51,069



2473
00:57:51,069 --> 00:57:52,529
always done this yes you

2474
00:57:52,529 --> 00:57:52,539



2475
00:57:52,539 --> 00:57:54,720
can write the f at the end or

2476
00:57:54,720 --> 00:57:54,730



2477
00:57:54,730 --> 00:57:56,070
write it in these numerators

2478
00:57:56,070 --> 00:57:56,080



2479
00:57:56,080 --> 00:57:58,140
that should mean the same

2480
00:57:58,140 --> 00:57:58,150



2481
00:57:58,150 --> 00:58:00,810
why do I put so much value on this

2482
00:58:00,810 --> 00:58:00,820



2483
00:58:00,820 --> 00:58:02,960
well that there is somehow a nice

2484
00:58:02,960 --> 00:58:02,970



2485
00:58:02,970 --> 00:58:07,620
notation and we will however later

2486
00:58:07,620 --> 00:58:07,630



2487
00:58:07,630 --> 00:58:09,780
consider for all f and then that

2488
00:58:09,780 --> 00:58:09,790



2489
00:58:09,790 --> 00:58:11,580
also sometimes leave out and then I would


2490
00:58:11,580 --> 00:58:11,590



2491
00:58:11,590 --> 00:58:13,590
consider this operator

2492
00:58:13,590 --> 00:58:13,600



2493
00:58:13,600 --> 00:58:16,430
ok and then I would have explained that

2494
00:58:16,430 --> 00:58:16,440



2495
00:58:16,440 --> 00:58:20,510
so this object we have here

2496
00:58:20,510 --> 00:58:20,520



2497
00:58:20,520 --> 00:58:25,080
and yes that is there at the back the thing now

2498
00:58:25,080 --> 00:58:25,090



2499
00:58:25,090 --> 00:58:27,500
I tell you but still about this what

2500
00:58:27,500 --> 00:58:27,510



2501
00:58:27,510 --> 00:58:31,500
look at this guy here x^j

2502
00:58:31,500 --> 00:58:31,510



2503
00:58:31,510 --> 00:58:34,890
gamma what is this x^j after

2504
00:58:34,890 --> 00:58:34,900



2505
00:58:34,900 --> 00:58:37,020
normal x after gamma we called q

2506
00:58:37,020 --> 00:58:37,030



2507
00:58:37,030 --> 00:58:37,920

2508
00:58:37,920 --> 00:58:37,930



2509
00:58:37,930 --> 00:58:41,430
that was the chart image of the curves have

2510
00:58:41,430 --> 00:58:41,440



2511
00:58:41,440 --> 00:58:42,510
you in physics actually until now

2512
00:58:42,510 --> 00:58:42,520



2513
00:58:42,520 --> 00:58:43,980
always done like this considered curves in

2514
00:58:43,980 --> 00:58:43,990



2515
00:58:43,990 --> 00:58:46,560
charts and the j-th

2516
00:58:46,560 --> 00:58:46,570



2517
00:58:46,570 --> 00:58:48,900
component of that thing is q^j

2518
00:58:48,900 --> 00:58:48,910



2519
00:58:48,910 --> 00:58:50,940
that means what here within the

2520
00:58:50,940 --> 00:58:50,950



2521
00:58:50,950 --> 00:58:53,900
brackets stands that is q^j

2522
00:58:53,900 --> 00:58:53,910



2523
00:58:53,910 --> 00:58:56,430
and that depends on some lambda

2524
00:58:56,430 --> 00:58:56,440



2525
00:58:56,440 --> 00:58:59,580
that means altogether with these settings

2526
00:58:59,580 --> 00:58:59,590



2527
00:58:59,590 --> 00:59:05,340
we now have good differentiated you

2528
00:59:05,340 --> 00:59:05,350



2529
00:59:05,350 --> 00:59:07,020
take the j-th component of the

2530
00:59:07,020 --> 00:59:07,030



2531
00:59:07,030 --> 00:59:09,480
chart representation of the function differentiate

2532
00:59:09,480 --> 00:59:09,490



2533
00:59:09,490 --> 00:59:12,359
it and then determine the value

2534
00:59:12,359 --> 00:59:12,369



2535
00:59:12,369 --> 00:59:13,200
at the point

2536
00:59:13,200 --> 00:59:13,210



2537
00:59:13,210 --> 00:59:18,990
lambda zero and then stands times partial

2538
00:59:19,550 --> NaN:NaN:NaN,NaN



2539
00:59:19,560 --> 00:59:21,680
at bottom

2540
00:59:21,680 --> 00:59:21,690



2541
00:59:21,690 --> 00:59:26,370
acting on the f and now we go

2542
00:59:26,370 --> 00:59:26,380



2543
00:59:26,380 --> 00:59:28,530
once more all the way back to the beginning and

2544
00:59:28,530 --> 00:59:28,540



2545
00:59:28,540 --> 00:59:33,660
then you see there stands X subscript gamma p on f equals

2546
00:59:33,660 --> 00:59:33,670



2547
00:59:33,670 --> 00:59:35,760
lalala I am here is still

2548
00:59:35,760 --> 00:59:35,770



2549
00:59:35,770 --> 00:59:38,330
my job equals blah blah blah blah blah

2550
00:59:38,330 --> 00:59:38,340



2551
00:59:38,340 --> 00:59:41,280
acting on f and of course we can

2552
00:59:41,280 --> 00:59:41,290



2553
00:59:41,290 --> 00:59:45,330
also put a bracket here then

2554
00:59:45,330 --> 00:59:45,340



2555
00:59:45,340 --> 00:59:48,000
what does it first this big apparatus

2556
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:48,010



2557
00:59:48,010 --> 00:59:50,070
through summation here over the j and

2558
00:59:50,070 --> 00:59:50,080



2559
00:59:50,080 --> 00:59:55,560
then act on the f what is the conclusion

2560
00:59:57,040 --> NaN:NaN:NaN,NaN



2561
00:59:57,050 --> 01:00:00,170
the conclusion is that this object X

2562
01:00:00,170 --> 01:00:00,180



2563
01:00:00,180 --> 01:00:03,380
subscript gamma p our directional derivative

2564
01:00:03,380 --> 01:00:03,390



2565
01:00:03,390 --> 01:00:06,850
along gamma at p can be written

2566
01:00:06,850 --> 01:00:06,860



2567
01:00:06,860 --> 01:00:12,100
as the derivative of the j-th coordinate

2568
01:00:12,100 --> 01:00:12,110



2569
01:00:12,110 --> 01:00:17,180
of the curve in the chart each individual

2570
01:00:17,180 --> 01:00:17,190



2571
01:00:17,190 --> 01:00:23,350
component is separately differentiated times

2572
01:00:23,350 --> 01:00:23,360



2573
01:00:23,360 --> 01:00:29,300
partial by partial x^j at p and that is a

2574
01:00:29,300 --> 01:00:29,310



2575
01:00:29,310 --> 01:00:32,420
differential operator that on functions

2576
01:00:32,420 --> 01:00:32,430



2577
01:00:32,430 --> 01:00:36,440
on the manifold can act

2578
01:00:37,090 --> NaN:NaN:NaN,NaN



2579
01:00:37,100 --> 01:00:41,150
yes and there have what these comrades here

2580
01:00:41,150 --> 01:00:41,160



2581
01:00:41,160 --> 01:00:45,740
they are called the components that there are

2582
01:00:45,740 --> 01:00:45,750



2583
01:00:45,750 --> 01:00:52,040
so definition are the components of the

2584
01:00:52,040 --> 01:00:52,050



2585
01:00:52,050 --> 01:00:55,340
of the tangent vector I write now

2586
01:00:55,340 --> 01:00:55,350



2587
01:00:55,350 --> 01:01:00,620
well yes the tangent vector you could

2588
01:00:00,620 --> 01:01:00,630



2589
01:01:00,630 --> 01:01:02,300
also call it the velocity vector

2590
01:01:02,300 --> 01:01:02,310



2591
01:01:02,310 --> 01:01:04,220
and the directional derivatives are the

2592
01:01:04,220 --> 01:01:04,230



2593
01:01:04,230 --> 01:01:08,260
components of the tangent vector of

2594
01:01:08,260 --> 01:01:08,270



2595
01:01:08,270 --> 01:01:13,520
gamma at point with respect to components

2596
01:01:13,520 --> 01:01:13,530



2597
01:01:13,530 --> 01:01:16,220
there are always only with respect to with respect to

2598
01:01:16,220 --> 01:01:16,230



2599
01:01:16,230 --> 01:01:23,720
the chart components with respect to the

2600
01:01:23,720 --> 01:01:23,730



2601
01:01:23,730 --> 01:01:28,310
chart x these are the things

2602
01:01:30,120 --> NaN:NaN:NaN,NaN



2603
01:01:30,130 --> 01:01:32,880
if these are the components of the tangent

2604
01:01:32,880 --> 01:01:32,890



2605
01:01:32,890 --> 01:01:35,910
vector they are just numbers for you

2606
01:01:35,910 --> 01:01:35,920



2607
01:01:35,920 --> 01:01:44,999
a 57 3 what is that yes when you

2608
01:01:44,999 --> 01:01:45,009



2609
01:01:45,009 --> 01:01:47,759
leave out units are the basis vectors

2610
01:01:47,759 --> 01:01:47,769



2611
01:01:47,769 --> 01:01:50,819
a unit vector there you would need a

2612
01:01:50,819 --> 01:01:50,829



2613
01:01:50,829 --> 01:01:53,400
metric or at least a norm to

2614
01:01:53,400 --> 01:01:53,410



2615
01:01:53,410 --> 01:01:56,039
say what that is but they are the

2616
01:01:56,039 --> 01:01:56,049



2617
01:01:56,049 --> 01:01:57,509
basis vectors you know from

2618
01:01:57,509 --> 01:01:57,519



2619
01:01:57,519 --> 01:01:59,730
linear algebra or you have the vector

2620
01:01:59,730 --> 01:01:59,740



2621
01:01:59,740 --> 01:02:02,309
space there you choose a basis and

2622
01:02:02,309 --> 01:02:02,319



2623
01:02:02,319 --> 01:02:04,529
as soon as you have chosen a basis has

2624
01:02:04,529 --> 01:02:04,539



2625
01:02:04,539 --> 01:02:07,859
an abstract vector has components

2626
01:02:07,859 --> 01:02:07,869



2627
01:02:07,869 --> 01:02:09,749
with respect to this basis you know that

2628
01:02:09,749 --> 01:02:09,759



2629
01:02:09,759 --> 01:02:14,460
or exactly that is it that is it and that

2630
01:02:14,460 --> 01:02:14,470



2631
01:02:14,470 --> 01:02:21,829
here that is for j equals one to d

2632
01:02:21,829 --> 01:02:21,839



2633
01:02:21,839 --> 01:02:32,660
are these the basis the by the chart x

2634
01:02:32,660 --> 01:02:32,670



2635
01:02:32,670 --> 01:02:39,839
induced induced basis vectors

2636
01:02:41,420 --> NaN:NaN:NaN,NaN



2637
01:02:41,430 --> 01:02:44,940
okay are the induced basis vectors

2638
01:02:44,940 --> 01:02:44,950



2639
01:02:44,950 --> 01:02:46,859
you know when you have a vector space

2640
01:02:46,859 --> 01:02:46,869



2641
01:02:46,869 --> 01:02:48,779
there you can choose a basis as

2642
01:02:48,779 --> 01:02:48,789



2643
01:02:48,789 --> 01:02:50,880
you like as long as it is a basis

2644
01:02:50,880 --> 01:02:50,890



2645
01:02:50,890 --> 01:02:52,319
or some world you can also choose

2646
01:02:52,319 --> 01:02:52,329



2647
01:02:52,329 --> 01:02:53,220
another one

2648
01:02:53,220 --> 01:02:53,230



2649
01:02:53,230 --> 01:02:55,079
now it seems here as if for

2650
01:02:55,079 --> 01:02:55,089



2651
01:02:55,089 --> 01:02:56,880
our tangent vectors as if there's

2652
01:02:56,880 --> 01:02:56,890



2653
01:02:56,890 --> 01:02:59,240
a distinguished basis

2654
01:02:59,240 --> 01:02:59,250



2655
01:02:59,250 --> 01:03:01,950
yes but it is only distinguished when

2656
01:03:01,950 --> 01:03:01,960



2657
01:03:01,960 --> 01:03:03,599
I have chosen a certain chart if

2658
01:03:03,599 --> 01:03:03,609



2659
01:03:03,609 --> 01:03:05,579
I had chosen another chart

2660
01:03:05,579 --> 01:03:05,589



2661
01:03:05,589 --> 01:03:07,440
I would have another distinguished

2662
01:03:07,440 --> 01:03:07,450



2663
01:03:07,450 --> 01:03:10,470
basis and thereby but the

2664
01:03:10,470 --> 01:03:10,480



2665
01:03:10,480 --> 01:03:12,660
velocity vector in the real world

2666
01:03:12,660 --> 01:03:12,670



2667
01:03:12,670 --> 01:03:14,819
so now a car drives by

2668
01:03:14,819 --> 01:03:14,829



2669
01:03:14,829 --> 01:03:16,920
it has the velocity it has

2670
01:03:16,920 --> 01:03:16,930



2671
01:03:16,930 --> 01:03:19,109
the velocity vector it has

2672
01:03:19,109 --> 01:03:19,119



2673
01:03:19,119 --> 01:03:21,660
thereby the velocity purpose the

2674
01:03:21,660 --> 01:03:21,670



2675
01:03:21,670 --> 01:03:25,049
abstract object in the real world that

2676
01:03:25,049 --> 01:03:25,059



2677
01:03:25,059 --> 01:03:27,390
must not depend on which chart

2678
01:03:27,390 --> 01:03:27,400



2679
01:03:27,400 --> 01:03:28,440
I have chosen

2680
01:03:28,440 --> 01:03:28,450



2681
01:03:28,450 --> 01:03:30,539
that means but if for another

2682
01:03:30,539 --> 01:03:30,549



2683
01:03:30,549 --> 01:03:33,749
chart another basis results for

2684
01:03:33,749 --> 01:03:33,759



2685
01:03:33,759 --> 01:03:35,999
this tangent space then

2686
01:03:35,999 --> 01:03:36,009



2687
01:03:36,009 --> 01:03:37,799
the components must also change

2688
01:03:37,799 --> 01:03:37,809



2689
01:03:37,809 --> 01:03:39,599
we know that also from linear

2690
01:03:39,599 --> 01:03:39,609



2691
01:03:39,609 --> 01:03:41,700
algebra one and the same vector has

2692
01:03:41,700 --> 01:03:41,710



2693
01:03:41,710 --> 01:03:43,590
with respect to different

2694
01:03:43,590 --> 01:03:43,600



2695
01:03:43,600 --> 01:03:46,350
bases different components and

2696
01:03:46,350 --> 01:03:46,360



2697
01:03:46,360 --> 01:03:47,660
here it is exactly the same

2698
01:03:47,660 --> 01:03:47,670



2699
01:03:47,670 --> 01:03:50,160
and when you in physics have

2700
01:03:50,160 --> 01:03:50,170



2701
01:03:50,170 --> 01:03:51,450
chosen a chart then your

2702
01:03:51,450 --> 01:03:51,460



2703
01:03:51,460 --> 01:03:54,290
velocity in God's name has concrete

2704
01:03:54,290 --> 01:03:54,300



2705
01:03:54,300 --> 01:03:56,070
components that you can then from me and

2706
01:03:56,070 --> 01:03:56,080



2707
01:03:56,080 --> 01:03:58,620
also as a vector tuple or whatever

2708
01:03:58,620 --> 01:03:58,630



2709
01:03:58,630 --> 01:04:00,810
write and you get them

2710
01:04:00,810 --> 01:04:00,820



2711
01:04:00,820 --> 01:04:02,580
of course by taking the path curve q


2712
01:04:02,580 --> 01:04:02,590



2713
01:04:02,590 --> 01:04:05,490
of lambda take and each individual

2714
01:04:05,490 --> 01:04:05,500



2715
01:04:05,500 --> 01:04:08,880
component of the path curve separately after

2716
01:04:08,880 --> 01:04:08,890



2717
01:04:08,890 --> 01:04:11,790
the path parameter differentiate right so

2718
01:04:11,790 --> 01:04:11,800



2719
01:04:11,800 --> 01:04:13,530
that's how you do it you have done that

2720
01:04:13,530 --> 01:04:13,540



2721
01:04:13,540 --> 01:04:18,030
or ok exactly and that is exactly this here

2722
01:04:18,030 --> 01:04:18,040



2723
01:04:18,040 --> 01:04:20,430
you have the things back but the

2724
01:04:20,430 --> 01:04:20,440



2725
01:04:20,440 --> 01:04:22,140
lesson we learn here is after all

2726
01:04:22,140 --> 01:04:22,150



2727
01:04:22,150 --> 01:04:24,330
a very important one the lesson is

2728
01:04:24,330 --> 01:04:24,340



2729
01:04:24,340 --> 01:04:26,220
namely that is not yet the

2730
01:04:26,220 --> 01:04:26,230



2731
01:04:26,230 --> 01:04:27,690
velocity vector

2732
01:04:27,690 --> 01:04:27,700



2733
01:04:27,700 --> 01:04:30,240
those are only the components the

2734
01:04:30,240 --> 01:04:30,250



2735
01:04:30,250 --> 01:04:31,710
don't make sense at all these

2736
01:04:31,710 --> 01:04:31,720



2737
01:04:31,720 --> 01:04:34,470
components without me knowing with respect

2738
01:04:34,470 --> 01:04:34,480



2739
01:04:34,480 --> 01:04:37,050
to which basis they should apply

2740
01:04:37,050 --> 01:04:37,060



2741
01:04:37,060 --> 01:04:38,850
we have here in this small

2742
01:04:38,850 --> 01:04:38,860



2743
01:04:38,860 --> 01:04:40,980
harmless calculation by saying we

2744
01:04:40,980 --> 01:04:40,990



2745
01:04:40,990 --> 01:04:42,600
want to see how this object

2746
01:04:42,600 --> 01:04:42,610



2747
01:04:42,610 --> 01:04:43,590
looks here we want to get to know

2748
01:04:43,590 --> 01:04:43,600



2749
01:04:43,600 --> 01:04:46,220
it better we have in one stroke

2750
01:04:46,220 --> 01:04:46,230



2751
01:04:46,230 --> 01:04:48,660
identified what this vector

2752
01:04:48,660 --> 01:04:48,670



2753
01:04:48,670 --> 01:04:50,160
altogether is then it's a real

2754
01:04:50,160 --> 01:04:50,170



2755
01:04:50,170 --> 01:04:52,200
equal sign this thing can

2756
01:04:52,200 --> 01:04:52,210



2757
01:04:52,210 --> 01:04:54,360
act on a function because that can

2758
01:04:54,360 --> 01:04:54,370



2759
01:04:54,370 --> 01:04:56,730
act on a function yes when in

2760
01:04:56,730 --> 01:04:56,740



2761
01:04:56,740 --> 01:04:59,220
one stroke identified what is for

2762
01:04:59,220 --> 01:04:59,230



2763
01:04:59,230 --> 01:05:00,960
an abstract a concrete so

2764
01:05:00,960 --> 01:05:00,970



2765
01:05:00,970 --> 01:05:03,720
a vector in the real world what are

2766
01:05:03,720 --> 01:05:03,730



2767
01:05:03,730 --> 01:05:05,340
the components with respect to which

2768
01:05:05,340 --> 01:05:05,350



2769
01:05:05,350 --> 01:05:08,310
basis and that is quite decisive and

2770
01:05:08,310 --> 01:05:08,320



2771
01:05:08,320 --> 01:05:10,020
after the break that we will now perhaps

2772
01:05:10,020 --> 01:05:10,030



2773
01:05:10,030 --> 01:05:13,350
make good ten minutes we will say

2774
01:05:13,350 --> 01:05:13,360



2775
01:05:13,360 --> 01:05:16,620
let's say exactly ten minutes we will

2776
01:05:16,620 --> 01:05:16,630



2777
01:05:16,630 --> 01:05:18,420
come back to what happens now

2778
01:05:18,420 --> 01:05:18,430



2779
01:05:18,430 --> 01:05:21,030
actually when I change the chart

2780
01:05:21,030 --> 01:05:21,040



2781
01:05:21,040 --> 01:05:23,280
what happens with the basis and what

2782
01:05:23,280 --> 01:05:23,290



2783
01:05:23,290 --> 01:05:25,290
happens with the components and that is of

2784
01:05:25,290 --> 01:05:25,300



2785
01:05:25,300 --> 01:05:27,840
highest importance after the break

2786
01:05:27,840 --> 01:05:27,850



2787
01:05:27,850 --> 01:05:36,540
so 17 after please 17:05

2788
01:05:40,150 --> NaN:NaN:NaN,NaN



2789
01:05:40,160 --> 01:05:43,180
changing charts

2790
01:05:47,130 --> NaN:NaN:NaN,NaN



2791
01:05:47,140 --> 01:05:51,210
so once more what was our situation

2792
01:05:51,210 --> 01:05:51,220



2793
01:05:51,220 --> 01:05:53,500
what was our situation we were

2794
01:05:53,500 --> 01:05:53,510



2795
01:05:53,510 --> 01:05:58,540
interested in the object X subscript

2796
01:05:58,540 --> 01:05:58,550



2797
01:05:58,550 --> 01:06:00,310
gamma at point p we were

2798
01:06:00,310 --> 01:06:00,320



2799
01:06:00,320 --> 01:06:02,200
interested in the tangent vector

2800
01:06:02,200 --> 01:06:02,210



2801
01:06:02,210 --> 01:06:04,630
to the curve gamma at point but had

2802
01:06:04,630 --> 01:06:04,640



2803
01:06:04,640 --> 01:06:06,610
also he not stated are

2804
01:06:06,610 --> 01:06:06,620



2805
01:06:06,620 --> 01:06:09,210
defined this is a

2806
01:06:09,210 --> 01:06:09,220



2807
01:06:09,220 --> 01:06:11,980
mapping namely a directional

2808
01:06:11,980 --> 01:06:11,990



2809
01:06:11,990 --> 01:06:17,470
derivative that eats a that eats a

2810
01:06:17,470 --> 01:06:17,480



2811
01:06:17,480 --> 01:06:20,500
smooth function and assigns it a

2812
01:06:20,500 --> 01:06:20,510



2813
01:06:20,510 --> 01:06:23,050
real number and we had understood this

2814
01:06:23,050 --> 01:06:23,060



2815
01:06:23,060 --> 01:06:26,260
object namely through choice

2816
01:06:26,260 --> 01:06:26,270



2817
01:06:26,270 --> 01:06:33,340
of a chart choice of chart x that was

2818
01:06:33,340 --> 01:06:33,350



2819
01:06:33,350 --> 01:06:35,200
a certain chart Wii comes of course

2820
01:06:35,200 --> 01:06:35,210



2821
01:06:35,210 --> 01:06:38,380
from the smooth atlas we had this

2822
01:06:38,380 --> 01:06:38,390



2823
01:06:38,390 --> 01:06:41,460
object understood suddenly as the

2824
01:06:41,460 --> 01:06:41,470



2825
01:06:41,470 --> 01:06:44,230
derivative of the individual components I

2826
01:06:44,230 --> 01:06:44,240



2827
01:06:44,240 --> 01:06:46,690
had just called q^j I call q

2828
01:06:46,690 --> 01:06:46,700



2829
01:06:46,700 --> 01:06:49,150
j now once more by the full name q

2830
01:06:49,150 --> 01:06:49,160



2831
01:06:49,160 --> 01:06:52,840
j was the j-th component of the curve

2832
01:06:52,840 --> 01:06:52,850



2833
01:06:52,850 --> 01:06:56,350
namely in these coordinates x this

2834
01:06:56,350 --> 01:06:56,360



2835
01:06:56,360 --> 01:06:58,990
thing we differentiated at which

2836
01:06:58,990 --> 01:06:59,000



2837
01:06:59,000 --> 01:07:01,000
point well at the right point at the

2838
01:07:01,000 --> 01:07:01,010



2839
01:07:01,010 --> 01:07:03,760
right parameter value lambda zero I

2840
01:07:03,760 --> 01:07:03,770



2841
01:07:03,770 --> 01:07:05,410
have the man a bit smaller on it

2842
01:07:05,410 --> 01:07:05,420



2843
01:07:05,420 --> 01:07:09,310
that was namely where the curve through

2844
01:07:09,310 --> 01:07:09,320



2845
01:07:09,320 --> 01:07:13,690
the point okay so these were the

2846
01:07:13,690 --> 01:07:13,700



2847
01:07:13,700 --> 01:07:17,910
derivative of the individual components of the

2848
01:07:17,910 --> 01:07:17,920



2849
01:07:17,920 --> 01:07:20,320
representation of the curve in the chart but

2850
01:07:20,320 --> 01:07:20,330



2851
01:07:20,330 --> 01:07:22,230
that of course cannot be the vector

2852
01:07:22,230 --> 01:07:22,240



2853
01:07:22,240 --> 01:07:24,430
those were first the components

2854
01:07:24,430 --> 01:07:24,440



2855
01:07:24,440 --> 01:07:27,400
and we had here a basis partial

2856
01:07:27,400 --> 01:07:27,410



2857
01:07:27,410 --> 01:07:33,280
by partial x^j at point p and you know this

2858
01:07:33,280 --> 01:07:33,290



2859
01:07:33,290 --> 01:07:35,590
object there I can now write a smooth

2860
01:07:35,590 --> 01:07:35,600



2861
01:07:35,600 --> 01:07:37,750
function at the end and then

2862
01:07:37,750 --> 01:07:37,760



2863
01:07:37,760 --> 01:07:39,400
you know how the object is defined

2864
01:07:39,400 --> 01:07:39,410



2865
01:07:39,410 --> 01:07:40,720
here you can also write a smooth

2866
01:07:40,720 --> 01:07:40,730



2867
01:07:40,730 --> 01:07:42,580
function at the end it gives

2868
01:07:42,580 --> 01:07:42,590



2869
01:07:42,590 --> 01:07:45,430
just for every smooth function you can

2870
01:07:45,430 --> 01:07:45,440



2871
01:07:45,440 --> 01:07:47,230
do that so we can now

2872
01:07:47,230 --> 01:07:47,240



2873
01:07:47,240 --> 01:07:49,510
here in yellow write something that you

2874
01:07:49,510 --> 01:07:49,520



2875
01:07:49,520 --> 01:07:51,460
can then think away again

2876
01:07:51,460 --> 01:07:51,470



2877
01:07:51,470 --> 01:07:53,530
that's why I make it yellow the yellow

2878
01:07:53,530 --> 01:07:53,540



2879
01:07:53,540 --> 01:07:55,410
you can optionally turn on or off

2880
01:07:55,410 --> 01:07:55,420



2881
01:07:55,420 --> 01:07:59,000
that should hold for every smooth function

2882
01:07:59,000 --> 01:07:59,010



2883
01:07:59,010 --> 01:08:01,190
when you write it you have an

2884
01:08:01,190 --> 01:08:01,200



2885
01:08:01,200 --> 01:08:03,950
equation between real numbers when

2886
01:08:03,950 --> 01:08:03,960



2887
01:08:03,960 --> 01:08:05,420
that stands often there stands left and right

2888
01:08:05,420 --> 01:08:05,430



2889
01:08:05,430 --> 01:08:06,740
of the equal sign it is a real

2890
01:08:06,740 --> 01:08:06,750



2891
01:08:06,750 --> 01:08:08,600
number and when you don't write

2892
01:08:08,600 --> 01:08:08,610



2893
01:08:08,610 --> 01:08:10,310
it there stands left and right of the

2894
01:08:10,310 --> 01:08:10,320



2895
01:08:10,320 --> 01:08:12,530
equal sign it is a mapping

2896
01:08:12,530 --> 01:08:12,540



2897
01:08:12,540 --> 01:08:14,650
namely from C infinity M

2898
01:08:14,650 --> 01:08:14,660



2899
01:08:14,660 --> 01:08:18,499
to the real numbers so I was

2900
01:08:18,499 --> 01:08:18,509



2901
01:08:18,509 --> 01:08:20,660
in a chart you could see the so

2902
01:08:20,660 --> 01:08:20,670



2903
01:08:20,670 --> 01:08:22,460
representations are the components of the

2904
01:08:22,460 --> 01:08:22,470



2905
01:08:22,470 --> 01:08:23,809
curve in this chart

2906
01:08:23,809 --> 01:08:23,819



2907
01:08:23,819 --> 01:08:26,720
that is the the basis here you can

2908
01:08:26,720 --> 01:08:26,730



2909
01:08:26,730 --> 01:08:29,240
but also write through choice of an

2910
01:08:29,240 --> 01:08:29,250



2911
01:08:29,250 --> 01:08:30,289
other chart

2912
01:08:30,289 --> 01:08:30,299



2913
01:08:30,299 --> 01:08:34,820
you now choose a chart psi y ok

2914
01:08:34,820 --> 01:08:34,830



2915
01:08:34,830 --> 01:08:37,039
and what does it look like then well then

2916
01:08:37,039 --> 01:08:37,049



2917
01:08:37,049 --> 01:08:39,079
you must of course the components of the

2918
01:08:39,079 --> 01:08:39,089



2919
01:08:39,089 --> 01:08:42,050
curve in these psi coordinates

2920
01:08:42,050 --> 01:08:42,060



2921
01:08:42,060 --> 01:08:44,620
consider at the right point

2922
01:08:44,620 --> 01:08:44,630



2923
01:08:44,630 --> 01:08:46,999
differentiate and then stands here

2924
01:08:46,999 --> 01:08:47,009



2925
01:08:47,009 --> 01:08:52,690
partial by partial epsilon^j p

2926
01:08:52,690 --> 01:08:52,700



2927
01:08:52,700 --> 01:08:54,320
of course that depends on the

2928
01:08:54,320 --> 01:08:54,330



2929
01:08:54,330 --> 01:08:58,039
chart choice and that is so twice

2930
01:08:58,039 --> 01:08:58,049



2931
01:08:58,049 --> 01:09:00,740
the same abstract object good one

2932
01:09:00,740 --> 01:09:00,750



2933
01:09:00,750 --> 01:09:02,390
can that I wished that once more

2934
01:09:02,400 --> 01:09:05,470
away then I can explain this more nicely

2935
01:09:05,470 --> 01:09:05,480



2936
01:09:05,480 --> 01:09:10,519
yes the decisive thing is the true object

2937
01:09:10,519 --> 01:09:10,529



2938
01:09:10,529 --> 01:09:13,300
is represented here in two ways but

2939
01:09:13,300 --> 01:09:13,310



2940
01:09:13,310 --> 01:09:15,530
of course the far left side and

2941
01:09:15,530 --> 01:09:15,540



2942
01:09:15,540 --> 01:09:17,749
the far right side they

2943
01:09:17,749 --> 01:09:17,759



2944
01:09:17,759 --> 01:09:19,400
must of course be the same

2945
01:09:19,400 --> 01:09:19,410



2946
01:09:19,410 --> 01:09:21,620
they only represent in

2947
01:09:21,620 --> 01:09:21,630



2948
01:09:21,630 --> 01:09:24,700
different charts the total object

2949
01:09:24,700 --> 01:09:24,710



2950
01:09:24,710 --> 01:09:28,640
altogether okay so and now I would

2951
01:09:28,640 --> 01:09:28,650



2952
01:09:28,650 --> 01:09:30,860
quite like to know let us

2953
01:09:30,860 --> 01:09:30,870



2954
01:09:30,870 --> 01:09:32,780
suppose we start with a chart x

2955
01:09:32,780 --> 01:09:32,790



2956
01:09:32,790 --> 01:09:35,180
now I have the components of the

2957
01:09:35,180 --> 01:09:35,190



2958
01:09:35,190 --> 01:09:37,130
curve in the chart x that is what one

2959
01:09:37,130 --> 01:09:37,140



2960
01:09:37,140 --> 01:09:39,740
usually does and suppose

2961
01:09:39,740 --> 01:09:39,750



2962
01:09:39,750 --> 01:09:42,200
someone is so mean and only gives you

2963
01:09:42,200 --> 01:09:42,210



2964
01:09:42,210 --> 01:09:44,210
the chart transition functions they say

2965
01:09:44,210 --> 01:09:44,220



2966
01:09:44,220 --> 01:09:45,559
here is the chart and now I have a

2967
01:09:45,559 --> 01:09:45,569



2968
01:09:45,569 --> 01:09:48,470
transition function you know the components

2969
01:09:48,470 --> 01:09:48,480



2970
01:09:48,480 --> 01:09:52,039
of the vector in one chart and the

2971
01:09:52,039 --> 01:09:52,049



2972
01:09:52,049 --> 01:09:54,440
question is what are then the

2973
01:09:54,440 --> 01:09:54,450



2974
01:09:54,450 --> 01:09:56,990
components of the vector in the other

2975
01:09:56,990 --> 01:09:57,000



2976
01:09:57,000 --> 01:09:59,900
chart if I provide the following chart

2977
01:09:59,900 --> 01:09:59,910



2978
01:09:59,910 --> 01:10:01,550
transition functions

2979
01:10:01,550 --> 01:10:01,560



2980
01:10:01,560 --> 01:10:03,860
this is a very natural question and

2981
01:10:03,860 --> 01:10:03,870



2982
01:10:03,870 --> 01:10:05,750
in practice it comes up when you

2983
01:10:05,750 --> 01:10:05,760



2984
01:10:05,760 --> 01:10:07,190
say I have a problem here that

2985
01:10:07,190 --> 01:10:07,200



2986
01:10:07,200 --> 01:10:08,780
somehow due to its physical

2987
01:10:08,780 --> 01:10:08,790



2988
01:10:08,790 --> 01:10:11,630
nature polar coordinates would

2989
01:10:11,630 --> 01:10:11,640



2990
01:10:11,640 --> 01:10:13,820
be suitable you have some

2991
01:10:13,820 --> 01:10:13,830



2992
01:10:13,830 --> 01:10:15,080
situation we might have some

2993
01:10:15,080 --> 01:10:15,090



2994
01:10:15,090 --> 01:10:16,850
vectors given with their components

2995
01:10:16,850 --> 01:10:16,860



2996
01:10:16,860 --> 01:10:19,100
in Cartesian coordinates and

2997
01:10:19,100 --> 01:10:19,110



2998
01:10:19,110 --> 01:10:21,560
now you say but the problem really

2999
01:10:21,560 --> 01:10:21,570



3000
01:10:21,570 --> 01:10:23,300
lends itself to being solved in polar

3001
01:10:23,300 --> 01:10:23,310



3002
01:10:23,310 --> 01:10:25,430
coordinates but you have to

3003
01:10:25,430 --> 01:10:25,440



3004
01:10:25,440 --> 01:10:27,320
convert your vector components to

3005
01:10:27,320 --> 01:10:27,330



3006
01:10:27,330 --> 01:10:30,740
polar coordinates yes with respect to

3007
01:10:30,740 --> 01:10:30,750



3008
01:10:30,750 --> 01:10:33,140
the polar coordinates chart it is a

3009
01:10:33,140 --> 01:10:33,150



3010
01:10:33,150 --> 01:10:36,290
very practical problem good and we

3011
01:10:36,290 --> 01:10:36,300



3012
01:10:36,300 --> 01:10:38,990
solve this once and for all by

3013
01:10:38,990 --> 01:10:39,000



3014
01:10:39,000 --> 01:10:40,370
namely seeing how vector

3015
01:10:40,370 --> 01:10:40,380



3016
01:10:40,380 --> 01:10:42,460
components transform

3017
01:10:42,460 --> 01:10:42,470



3018
01:10:42,470 --> 01:10:46,010
the trick will be the following this is

3019
01:10:46,010 --> 01:10:46,020



3020
01:10:46,020 --> 01:10:48,140
vector components times basis so

3021
01:10:48,140 --> 01:10:48,150



3022
01:10:48,150 --> 01:10:50,510
vector components times basis if

3023
01:10:50,510 --> 01:10:50,520



3024
01:10:50,520 --> 01:10:52,520
I had the same basis on both sides

3025
01:10:52,520 --> 01:10:52,530



3026
01:10:52,530 --> 01:10:55,070
then I could compare the components

3027
01:10:55,070 --> 01:10:55,080



3028
01:10:55,080 --> 01:10:55,970
right

3029
01:10:55,970 --> 01:10:55,980



3030
01:10:55,980 --> 01:11:00,260
why why are two vectors

3031
01:09:00,260 --> 01:11:00,270



3032
01:11:00,270 --> 01:11:02,060
that have the same components with respect to

3033
01:11:02,060 --> 01:11:02,070



3034
01:11:02,070 --> 01:11:06,980
the same basis already equal

3035
01:11:08,020 --> NaN:NaN:NaN,NaN



3036
01:11:08,030 --> 01:11:15,380
please please yes why why know exactly

3037
01:11:15,380 --> 01:11:15,390



3038
01:11:15,390 --> 01:11:16,910
the same is indeed a mathematical

3039
01:11:16,910 --> 01:11:16,920



3040
01:11:16,920 --> 01:11:20,300
argument what is a basis a linearly

3041
01:11:20,300 --> 01:11:20,310



3042
01:11:20,310 --> 01:11:22,700
independent generating system what is

3043
01:11:22,700 --> 01:11:22,710



3044
01:11:22,710 --> 01:11:24,350
important generating system or linear

3045
01:11:24,350 --> 01:11:24,360



3046
01:11:24,360 --> 01:11:25,970
independence so that I can conclude this

3047
01:11:25,970 --> 01:11:25,980



3048
01:11:25,980 --> 01:11:28,000
because I want to conclude

3049
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:28,010



3050
01:11:28,010 --> 01:11:30,260
linear yes independent of course that is

3051
01:11:30,260 --> 01:11:30,270



3052
01:11:30,270 --> 01:11:32,420
exactly the meaning behind the definition of

3053
01:11:32,420 --> 01:11:32,430



3054
01:11:32,430 --> 01:11:33,260
linear independence

3055
01:11:33,260 --> 01:11:33,270

3056
01:11:33,270 --> 01:11:34,610
if you have ever asked yourself how

3057
01:11:34,610 --> 01:11:34,620



3058
01:11:34,620 --> 01:11:36,020
one arrives at such a definition of linear

3059
01:11:36,020 --> 01:11:36,030



3060
01:11:36,030 --> 01:11:37,520
independence this one with this

3061
01:11:37,520 --> 01:11:37,530



3062
01:11:37,530 --> 01:11:39,200
model that is if lambda is all zero

3063
01:11:39,200 --> 01:11:39,210



3064
01:11:39,210 --> 01:11:40,610
and so on and so forth ask yourself

3065
01:11:40,610 --> 01:11:40,620



3066
01:11:40,620 --> 01:11:42,230
the question in this context then

3067
01:11:42,230 --> 01:11:42,240



3068
01:11:42,240 --> 01:11:44,270
you see exactly that is the meaning why

3069
01:11:44,270 --> 01:11:44,280



3070
01:11:44,280 --> 01:11:45,830
you want linear independence so that

3071
01:11:45,830 --> 01:11:45,840



3072
01:11:45,840 --> 01:11:48,200
with the same basis and then you can

3073
01:11:48,200 --> 01:11:48,210



3074
01:11:48,210 --> 01:11:50,000
compare the components

3075
01:11:50,000 --> 01:11:50,010



3076
01:11:50,010 --> 01:11:52,940
okay we do that now and yes I

3077
01:11:52,940 --> 01:11:52,950



3078
01:11:52,950 --> 01:11:54,200
cannot do that because here I have

3079
01:11:54,200 --> 01:11:54,210



3080
01:11:54,210 --> 01:11:56,600
this basis the d by dx and there

3081
01:11:56,600 --> 01:11:56,610



3082
01:11:56,610 --> 01:11:59,660
the basis d by dy j so good let us

3083
01:11:59,660 --> 01:11:59,670



3084
01:11:59,670 --> 01:12:01,100
first convert the basis

3085
01:12:01,100 --> 01:12:01,110



3086
01:12:01,110 --> 01:12:02,690
when we have converted the basis

3087
01:12:02,690 --> 01:12:02,700



3088
01:12:02,700 --> 01:12:05,830
the rest follows a conversion of the basis

3089
01:12:05,830 --> 01:12:05,840



3090
01:12:05,840 --> 01:12:12,260
so goal express

3091
01:12:12,260 --> 01:12:12,270



3092
01:12:12,270 --> 01:12:21,800
the d by dy j at p

3093
01:12:21,800 --> 01:12:21,810



3094
01:12:21,810 --> 01:12:30,350
through the d by dx j at p and the basis

3095
01:12:30,350 --> 01:12:30,360



3096
01:12:30,360 --> 01:12:35,680
which which data transition map

3097
01:12:35,680 --> 01:12:35,690



3098
01:12:35,690 --> 01:12:38,060
how is it from one to the

3099
01:12:38,060 --> 01:12:38,070



3100
01:12:38,070 --> 01:12:39,350
other chart unfortunately it is something

3101
01:12:39,350 --> 01:12:39,360



3102
01:12:39,360 --> 01:12:43,370
psi composed with x inverse or something plus

3103
01:12:43,370 --> 01:12:43,380



3104
01:12:43,380 --> 01:12:49,240
x inverse that is our goal so strategy

3105
01:12:49,240 --> 01:12:49,250



3106
01:12:49,250 --> 01:12:54,140
as I have already explained here

3107
01:12:55,960 --> NaN:NaN:NaN,NaN



3108
01:12:55,970 --> 01:12:59,480
first express the basis d by

3109
01:12:59,480 --> 01:12:59,490



3110
01:12:59,490 --> 01:13:04,040
dx j was d by dx j at point p

3111
01:13:04,040 --> 01:13:04,050



3112
01:13:04,050 --> 01:13:06,710
we want to write this now first as

3113
01:13:06,710 --> 01:13:06,720



3114
01:13:06,720 --> 01:13:08,780
d by d psi j and then we can

3115
01:13:08,780 --> 01:13:08,790



3116
01:13:08,790 --> 01:13:09,680
continue

3117
01:13:09,680 --> 01:13:09,690



3118
01:13:09,690 --> 01:13:12,470
ok so how do we do this what is this

3119
01:13:12,470 --> 01:13:12,480



3120
01:13:12,480 --> 01:13:15,230
object old rule when playing with the

3121
01:13:15,230 --> 01:13:15,240



3122
01:13:15,240 --> 01:13:16,940
object we must look what is the

3123
01:13:16,940 --> 01:13:16,950



3124
01:12:16,950 --> 01:13:18,920
definition of the object we understand the

3125
01:13:18,920 --> 01:13:18,930



3126
01:13:18,930 --> 01:13:21,170
object quite well when we let it act

3127
01:13:21,170 --> 01:13:21,180



3128
01:13:21,180 --> 01:13:23,990
on an f but caution it is

3129
01:13:23,990 --> 01:13:24,000



3130
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:28,130
a function on the whole

3131
01:13:28,130 --> 01:13:28,140



3132
01:13:28,140 --> 01:13:31,460
manifold when it acts on f what

3133
01:13:31,460 --> 01:13:31,470



3134
01:13:31,470 --> 01:13:34,310
is the definition of this thing we

3135
01:13:34,310 --> 01:13:34,320



3136
01:13:34,320 --> 01:13:35,540
just wrote it down I said

3137
01:13:35,540 --> 01:13:35,550



3138
01:13:35,550 --> 01:13:37,280
it is this beautiful

3139
01:13:37,280 --> 01:13:37,290



3140
01:13:37,290 --> 01:13:38,090
symbol

3141
01:13:38,090 --> 01:13:38,100



3142
01:13:38,100 --> 01:13:42,050
there is a d and below something

3143
01:13:42,050 --> 01:13:42,060



3144
01:13:42,060 --> 01:13:44,690
stands and then there is a function that is

3145
01:13:44,690 --> 01:13:44,700



3146
01:13:44,700 --> 01:13:48,020
the f and then here after something

3147
01:13:48,020 --> 01:13:48,030



3148
01:13:48,030 --> 01:13:49,940
to the power minus one close parenthesis

3149
01:13:49,940 --> 01:13:49,950



3150
01:13:49,950 --> 01:13:51,530
and then this is evaluated at

3151
01:13:51,530 --> 01:13:51,540



3152
01:13:51,540 --> 01:13:53,800
something at the point

3153
01:13:53,800 --> 01:13:53,810



3154
01:13:53,810 --> 01:13:57,530
something so analogously what is that

3155
01:13:57,530 --> 01:13:57,540



3156
01:13:57,540 --> 01:14:00,950
something there this j it goes here

3157
01:13:00,950 --> 01:14:00,960



3158
01:14:00,960 --> 01:14:04,100
this x goes here the f comes

3159
01:14:04,100 --> 01:14:04,110



3160
01:14:04,110 --> 01:14:06,500
once more here and the p from down here

3161
01:14:06,500 --> 01:14:06,510



3162
01:14:06,510 --> 01:14:07,670
goes there

3163
01:14:07,670 --> 01:14:07,680



3164
01:14:07,680 --> 01:14:11,300
that is the object by definition ok

3165
01:14:11,300 --> 01:14:11,310



3166
01:14:11,310 --> 01:14:14,390
will only demonstrate once you see the

3167
01:14:14,390 --> 01:14:14,400



3168
01:14:14,400 --> 01:14:18,290
object please do not jump too

3169
01:14:18,290 --> 01:14:18,300



3170
01:14:18,300 --> 01:14:20,180
jump whatever not too fast

3171
01:14:20,180 --> 01:14:20,190



3172
01:14:20,190 --> 01:14:20,960
conclude

3173
01:14:20,960 --> 01:14:20,970



3174
01:14:20,970 --> 01:14:23,540
that is the thing

3175
01:14:23,540 --> 01:14:23,550



3176
01:14:23,550 --> 01:14:26,540
oh yes good that is it now what

3177
01:14:26,540 --> 01:14:26,550

3178
01:14:26,550 --> 01:14:28,760
we wanted to do something we wanted

3179
01:14:28,760 --> 01:14:28,770



3180
01:14:28,770 --> 01:14:30,979
to transition to another chart

3181
01:14:30,979 --> 01:14:30,989



3182
01:14:30,989 --> 01:14:32,510
and now we have already made quite good

3183
01:14:32,510 --> 01:14:32,520



3184
01:14:32,520 --> 01:14:33,830
experiences could now again draw

3185
01:14:33,830 --> 01:14:33,840



3186
01:14:33,840 --> 01:14:35,689
diagrams but we have made quite

3187
01:14:35,689 --> 01:14:35,699



3188
01:14:35,699 --> 01:14:37,609
good experiences now only

3189
01:14:37,609 --> 01:14:37,619



3190
01:14:37,619 --> 01:14:38,990
the chart x appears here

3191
01:14:38,990 --> 01:14:39,000



3192
01:14:39,000 --> 01:14:42,020
we simply throw in the chart y

3193
01:14:42,020 --> 01:14:42,030



3194
01:14:42,030 --> 01:14:45,430
here and how do I throw it in

3195
01:14:45,430 --> 01:14:45,440



3196
01:14:45,440 --> 01:14:49,819
I may in any case here now stands

3197
01:14:49,819 --> 01:14:49,829



3198
01:14:49,829 --> 01:14:51,799
x inverse somehow I want to add

3199
01:14:51,799 --> 01:14:51,809



3200
01:14:51,809 --> 01:14:53,540
psi inverse so let me write

3201
01:14:53,540 --> 01:14:53,550



3202
01:14:53,550 --> 01:14:55,129
immediately undo again

3203
01:14:55,129 --> 01:14:55,139



3204
01:14:55,139 --> 01:14:58,850
yes sleight of hand and then there must

3205
01:14:58,850 --> 01:14:58,860



3206
01:14:58,860 --> 01:15:01,069
be x inverse again when one

3207
01:15:01,069 --> 01:15:01,079



3208
01:15:01,079 --> 01:15:04,640
has x of p and actually everything is still

3209
01:15:04,640 --> 01:15:04,650



3210
01:15:04,650 --> 01:15:09,319
exactly as before or aha but

3211
01:15:09,319 --> 01:15:09,329



3212
01:15:09,329 --> 01:15:10,459
now I have here of course again

3213
01:15:10,459 --> 01:15:10,469



3214
01:15:10,469 --> 01:15:12,549
this case this beautiful case

3215
01:15:12,549 --> 01:15:12,559



3216
01:15:12,559 --> 01:15:14,839
that I can now bracket here again

3217
01:14:14,839 --> 01:15:14,849



3218
01:15:14,849 --> 01:15:16,299
like this

3219
01:15:16,299 --> 01:15:16,309



3220
01:15:16,309 --> 01:15:18,169
and now let us briefly make clear

3221
01:15:18,169 --> 01:15:18,179



3222
01:15:18,179 --> 01:15:20,089
what kind of objects these are that

3223
01:15:20,089 --> 01:15:20,099



3224
01:15:20,099 --> 01:15:21,379
we are looking at

3225
01:15:21,379 --> 01:15:21,389



3226
01:15:21,389 --> 01:15:25,669
so the first is a map f composed with

3227
01:15:25,669 --> 01:15:25,679



3228
01:15:25,679 --> 01:15:29,540
psi inverse that goes from a part of

3229
01:15:29,540 --> 01:15:29,550



3230
01:15:29,550 --> 01:15:31,609
R^d namely the psi of the

3231
01:15:31,609 --> 01:15:31,619



3232
01:15:31,619 --> 01:15:34,299
psi chart goes into the real numbers

3233
01:15:34,299 --> 01:15:34,309



3234
01:15:34,309 --> 01:15:36,859
and this one yes also we know

3235
01:15:36,859 --> 01:15:36,869



3236
01:15:36,869 --> 01:15:38,060
that one that is yet another chart

3237
01:15:38,060 --> 01:15:38,070



3238
01:15:38,070 --> 01:15:40,729
transition map that goes from R^d

3239
01:15:40,729 --> 01:15:40,739



3240
01:15:40,739 --> 01:15:43,609
to R^d so roughly you know

3241
01:15:43,609 --> 01:15:43,619



3242
01:15:43,619 --> 01:15:45,319
it only goes from domains that is also

3243
01:15:45,319 --> 01:15:45,329



3244
01:15:45,329 --> 01:15:48,290
domains of R^d what matters is that

3245
01:15:48,290 --> 01:15:48,300



3246
01:15:48,300 --> 01:15:49,760
we are familiar with the mathematics

3247
01:15:49,760 --> 01:15:49,770



3248
01:15:49,770 --> 01:15:51,830
here we can simply differentiate

3249
01:15:51,830 --> 01:15:51,840



3250
01:15:51,840 --> 01:15:55,669
okay what is this here multidimensional

3251
01:15:55,669 --> 01:15:55,679



3252
01:15:55,679 --> 01:15:57,439
chain rule 20

3253
01:15:57,439 --> 01:15:57,449



3254
01:15:57,449 --> 01:15:59,810
only now it is not just

3255
01:15:59,810 --> 01:15:59,820



3256
01:15:59,820 --> 01:16:01,069
simply differentiate by a parameter

3257
01:16:01,069 --> 01:16:01,079



3258
01:16:01,079 --> 01:16:03,530
but the partial derivative so I

3259
01:16:03,530 --> 01:16:03,540



3260
01:16:03,540 --> 01:16:04,760
mean the people are the derivative in the

3261
01:16:04,760 --> 01:16:04,770



3262
01:16:04,770 --> 01:16:07,549
j direction good let us continue how

3263
01:16:07,549 --> 01:16:07,559



3264
01:16:07,559 --> 01:16:09,069
does this work

3265
01:16:09,069 --> 01:16:09,079



3266
01:16:09,079 --> 01:16:13,490
so this is the outer derivative that is

3267
01:16:13,490 --> 01:16:13,500



3268
01:16:13,500 --> 01:16:15,950
somehow this thing and then comes

3269
01:15:15,950 --> 01:16:15,960



3270
01:16:15,960 --> 01:16:18,169
later the thing well let us start

3271
01:16:18,169 --> 01:16:18,179



3272
01:16:18,179 --> 01:16:20,799
the outer derivative and that is del

3273
01:16:20,799 --> 01:16:20,809



3274
01:16:20,809 --> 01:16:23,899
so it arises also j remember

3275
01:16:23,899 --> 01:16:23,909



3276
01:16:23,909 --> 01:16:25,370
before we differentiated the whole thing

3277
01:16:25,370 --> 01:16:25,380



3278
01:16:25,380 --> 01:16:27,560
by lambda prime and still the

3279
01:16:27,560 --> 01:16:27,570



3280
01:16:27,570 --> 01:16:29,810
front one in one direction we do this

3281
01:16:29,810 --> 01:16:29,820



3282
01:16:29,820 --> 01:16:32,959
again again that is del m j of f

3283
01:16:32,959 --> 01:16:32,969



3284
01:16:32,969 --> 01:16:36,250
composed with psi to the power minus one

3285
01:16:36,250 --> 01:16:36,260



3286
01:16:36,260 --> 01:16:37,600
where do we evaluate this well

3287
01:16:37,600 --> 01:16:37,610



3288
01:16:37,610 --> 01:16:41,830
of course at psi composed with x inverse

3289
01:16:41,830 --> 01:16:41,840



3290
01:16:41,840 --> 01:16:44,169
of x of p but that is of course

3291
01:16:44,169 --> 01:16:44,179



3292
01:16:44,179 --> 01:16:47,109
psi of p that looks

3293
01:16:47,109 --> 01:16:47,119



3294
01:16:47,119 --> 01:16:49,419
pretty good so and now comes

3295
01:16:49,419 --> 01:16:49,429



3296
01:16:49,429 --> 01:16:51,850
now we have namely here chain rule

3297
01:16:51,850 --> 01:16:51,860



3298
01:16:51,860 --> 01:16:54,549
and now this m namely goes with the

3299
01:16:54,549 --> 01:16:54,559

3300
01:16:54,559 --> 01:16:57,250
m-th component of this fellow

3301
01:16:57,250 --> 01:16:57,260



3302
01:16:57,260 --> 01:16:57,759
here

3303
01:16:57,759 --> 01:16:57,769



3304
01:16:57,769 --> 01:17:03,700
so this acts on psi m composed with x inverse

3305
01:17:03,700 --> 01:17:03,710



3306
01:17:03,710 --> 01:17:05,649
I could also write the superscript m outside

3307
01:17:05,649 --> 01:17:05,659



3308
01:17:05,659 --> 01:17:06,970
that makes no

3309
01:17:06,970 --> 01:17:06,980



3310
01:17:06,980 --> 01:17:09,970
difference ok and this is now

3311
01:17:09,970 --> 01:17:09,980



3312
01:17:09,980 --> 01:17:12,970
differentiated by the j-th component d_j

3313
01:17:12,970 --> 01:17:12,980



3314
01:17:12,980 --> 01:17:16,240
the inner derivative is the direct

3315
01:17:16,240 --> 01:17:16,250



3316
01:17:16,250 --> 01:17:17,830
type of derivative it is simply the

3317
01:17:17,830 --> 01:17:17,840



3318
01:17:17,840 --> 01:17:20,080
multidimensional chain rule and where

3319
01:17:20,080 --> 01:17:20,090



3320
01:17:20,090 --> 01:17:21,939
we had the outer one we will

3321
01:17:21,939 --> 01:17:21,949



3322
01:17:21,949 --> 01:17:26,979
also again evaluate at x of p so

3323
01:17:26,979 --> 01:17:26,989



3324
01:17:26,989 --> 01:17:29,470
of course the j is free it is

3325
01:17:29,470 --> 01:17:29,480



3326
01:17:29,480 --> 01:17:31,720
discussed there is only one j but

3327
01:17:31,720 --> 01:17:31,730



3328
01:17:31,730 --> 01:17:33,250
as always with the chain rule or as

3329
01:17:33,250 --> 01:17:33,260



3330
01:17:33,260 --> 01:17:35,529
always in all my formulas when an

3331
01:17:35,529 --> 01:17:35,539



3332
01:17:35,539 --> 01:17:37,600
index is up and an index is down there is

3333
01:17:37,600 --> 01:17:37,610



3334
01:17:37,610 --> 01:17:40,779
an implied summation that stands

3335
01:17:40,779 --> 01:17:40,789



3336
01:17:40,789 --> 01:17:42,970
so as if a sum m equals

3337
01:17:42,970 --> 01:17:42,980



3338
01:17:42,980 --> 01:17:44,560
one to dimension

3339
01:17:44,560 --> 01:17:44,570



3340
01:17:44,570 --> 01:17:47,080
were written in front first exercise sheet

3341
01:17:47,080 --> 01:17:47,090



3342
01:17:47,090 --> 01:17:49,029
summation convention is just shorthand

3343
01:17:49,029 --> 01:17:49,039



3344
01:17:49,039 --> 01:17:50,439
notation because after the formula

3345
01:17:50,439 --> 01:17:50,449



3346
01:17:50,449 --> 01:17:51,970
we have with many repeated

3347
01:17:51,970 --> 01:17:51,980



3348
01:17:51,980 --> 01:17:54,100
indices and the board would already be full

3349
01:17:54,100 --> 01:17:54,110



3350
01:17:54,110 --> 01:17:55,270
if we wrote the summation signs

3351
01:17:55,270 --> 01:17:55,280



3352
01:17:55,280 --> 01:17:56,410
that is why we leave

3353
01:17:56,410 --> 01:17:56,420



3354
01:17:56,420 --> 01:17:59,529
them all out so is everyone in agreement

3355
01:17:59,529 --> 01:17:59,539



3356
01:17:59,539 --> 01:18:00,970
that this is the application of the

3357
01:18:00,970 --> 01:18:00,980



3358
01:18:00,980 --> 01:18:02,529
multidimensional chain rule to

3359
01:18:02,529 --> 01:18:02,539



3360
01:18:02,539 --> 01:18:06,310
this case one needs to practice

3361
01:18:06,310 --> 01:18:06,320



3362
01:18:06,320 --> 01:18:08,080
a bit until one can do it but

3363
01:18:08,080 --> 01:18:08,090



3364
01:18:08,090 --> 01:18:09,910
admittedly this is first semester

3365
01:18:09,910 --> 01:18:09,920



3366
01:18:09,920 --> 01:18:11,859
material for physicists or so multi

3367
01:18:11,859 --> 01:18:11,869



3368
01:18:11,869 --> 01:18:14,560
dimensional chain rule yes take

3369
01:18:14,560 --> 01:18:14,570



3370
01:18:14,570 --> 01:18:17,830
my engineering book so we need

3371
01:17:17,830 --> 01:18:17,840



3372
01:18:17,840 --> 01:18:19,629
this continuously without it it does not work

3373
01:18:19,629 --> 01:18:19,639



3374
01:18:19,639 --> 01:18:21,850
you can look this up again has

3375
01:18:21,850 --> 01:18:21,860



3376
01:18:21,860 --> 01:18:29,319
for me on the exercise sheet so yes please the

3377
01:18:29,319 --> 01:18:29,329



3378
01:18:29,329 --> 01:18:30,009
small m

3379
01:18:30,009 --> 01:18:30,019



3380
01:18:30,019 --> 01:18:32,830
that is the that is the derivative in the

3381
01:18:32,830 --> 01:18:32,840



3382
01:18:32,840 --> 01:18:35,470
m-th direction and the m-th

3383
01:18:35,470 --> 01:18:35,480



3384
01:18:35,480 --> 01:18:37,509
component that is because this function

3385
01:18:37,509 --> 01:18:37,519



3386
01:18:37,519 --> 01:18:40,899
these domains have I must sum over

3387
01:18:40,899 --> 01:18:40,909



3388
01:18:40,909 --> 01:18:43,510
that

3389
01:18:44,439 --> NaN:NaN:NaN,NaN



3390
01:18:44,449 --> 01:18:46,270
so what you are actually asking

3391
01:18:46,270 --> 01:18:46,280



3392
01:18:46,280 --> 01:18:47,680
of me now is the proof of the chain rule

3393
01:18:47,680 --> 01:18:47,690



3394
01:18:47,690 --> 01:18:50,640
for multidimensional functions

3395
01:18:50,640 --> 01:18:50,650



3396
01:18:50,650 --> 01:19:03,699
precisely because this is the total function

3397
01:19:03,699 --> 01:19:03,709



3398
01:19:03,709 --> 01:19:05,709
that you differentiate that you now understand

3399
01:19:05,709 --> 01:19:05,719



3400
01:19:05,719 --> 01:19:07,989
as a composition of this part and

3401
01:19:07,989 --> 01:19:07,999



3402
01:19:07,999 --> 01:19:11,500
that part ok and the derivative that acts

3403
01:19:11,500 --> 01:19:11,510



3404
01:19:11,510 --> 01:19:14,379
on everything how comes in the chain

3405
01:19:14,379 --> 01:19:14,389



3406
01:19:14,389 --> 01:19:19,060
rule via the inner derivative so

3407
01:19:19,060 --> 01:19:19,070



3408
01:19:19,070 --> 01:19:21,310
that is we had the case there was

3409
01:19:21,310 --> 01:19:21,320



3410
01:19:21,320 --> 01:19:22,629
not the derivative in the m-th direction

3411
01:19:22,629 --> 01:19:22,639



3412
01:19:22,639 --> 01:19:24,219
because it was another function but the

3413
01:19:24,219 --> 01:19:24,229



3414
01:18:24,229 --> 01:19:26,319
derivative by a parameter the

3415
01:19:26,319 --> 01:19:26,329



3416
01:19:26,329 --> 01:19:29,739
lambda prime which then also came later

3417
01:19:29,739 --> 01:19:29,749



3418
01:19:29,749 --> 01:19:32,290
via the inner derivative so

3419
01:19:32,290 --> 01:19:32,300



3420
01:19:32,300 --> 01:19:33,790
what acts on everything always stands at the

3421
01:19:33,790 --> 01:19:33,800

3422
01:19:33,800 --> 01:19:35,890
inner derivative and the rest is

3423
01:19:35,890 --> 01:19:35,900



3424
01:19:35,900 --> 01:19:37,089
then summed over with the

3425
01:19:37,089 --> 01:19:37,099



3426
01:19:37,099 --> 01:19:39,239
repeated index summed over

3427
01:19:39,239 --> 01:19:39,249



3428
01:19:39,249 --> 01:19:43,330
that is how the chain rule works if

3429
01:19:43,330 --> 01:19:43,340



3430
01:19:43,340 --> 01:19:44,620
you want I can at some point make

3431
01:19:44,620 --> 01:19:44,630



3432
01:19:44,630 --> 01:19:46,689
a digression and draw a nice picture

3433
01:19:46,689 --> 01:19:46,699



3434
01:19:46,699 --> 01:19:48,189
for the chain rule so but best

3435
01:19:48,189 --> 01:19:48,199



3436
01:19:48,199 --> 01:19:49,629
look in the first engineering

3437
01:19:49,629 --> 01:19:49,639



3438
01:19:49,639 --> 01:19:50,919
book yes everyone understands that

3439
01:19:50,919 --> 01:19:50,929



3440
01:19:50,929 --> 01:19:58,149
that is long no means I know I say

3441
01:19:58,149 --> 01:19:58,159



3442
01:19:58,159 --> 01:19:58,810
nothing more

3443
01:19:58,810 --> 01:19:58,820



3444
01:19:58,820 --> 01:20:01,750
ok so take for example a

3445
01:20:01,750 --> 01:20:01,760



3446
01:20:01,760 --> 01:20:04,479
very good book is Papula

3447
01:20:04,479 --> 01:20:04,489



3448
01:20:04,489 --> 01:20:06,040
Mathematics for Engineers

3449
01:20:06,040 --> 01:20:06,050



3450
01:20:06,050 --> 01:20:07,089
Natural Scientists and all

3451
01:20:07,089 --> 01:20:07,099



3452
01:20:07,099 --> 01:20:08,859
other faiths and you get into it

3453
01:20:08,859 --> 01:20:08,869



3454
01:20:08,869 --> 01:20:10,299
that is probably somehow volume 2

3455
01:20:10,299 --> 01:20:10,309



3456
01:20:10,309 --> 01:20:12,580
1 3 or something and there it stands

3457
01:20:12,580 --> 01:20:12,590



3458
01:20:12,590 --> 01:20:15,160
wonderfully with 1000 examples so you

3459
01:20:15,160 --> 01:20:15,170



3460
01:20:15,170 --> 01:20:16,930
must be able to do this this is here now

3461
01:20:16,930 --> 01:20:16,940



3462
01:20:16,940 --> 01:20:18,939
because there is so much decoration the

3463
01:20:18,939 --> 01:20:18,949



3464
01:20:18,949 --> 01:20:22,000
y of p and such everything looks so powerful

3465
01:20:22,000 --> 01:20:22,010



3466
01:20:22,010 --> 01:20:23,979
it is all quite simple yes the

3467
01:20:23,979 --> 01:20:23,989



3468
01:20:23,989 --> 01:20:28,209
application to this case good so ok

3469
01:20:28,209 --> 01:20:28,219



3470
01:20:28,219 --> 01:20:29,350
now we have clearly rewritten

3471
01:20:29,350 --> 01:20:29,360



3472
01:20:29,360 --> 01:20:32,290
the thing now we recognize but

3473
01:20:32,290 --> 01:20:32,300



3474
01:20:32,300 --> 01:20:35,890
of course aha because here is

3475
01:20:35,890 --> 01:20:35,900



3476
01:20:35,900 --> 01:20:40,509
of course nothing other than the d by

3477
01:20:40,509 --> 01:20:40,519



3478
01:20:40,519 --> 01:20:46,989
d psi m at the point p and

3479
01:20:46,989 --> 01:20:46,999



3480
01:20:46,999 --> 01:20:49,029
this thing here we of course recognize

3481
01:20:49,029 --> 01:20:49,039



3482
01:20:49,039 --> 01:20:50,859
immediately this is nothing other than the

3483
01:20:50,859 --> 01:20:50,869



3484
01:20:50,869 --> 01:20:52,569
I can let this jump in here

3485
01:20:52,569 --> 01:20:52,579



3486
01:20:52,579 --> 01:20:54,850


3487
01:20:54,850 --> 01:20:54,860



3488
01:20:54,860 --> 01:20:59,479
d by dx j also at the point

3489
01:20:59,479 --> 01:20:59,489



3490
01:20:59,489 --> 01:21:02,450
and in between stands times real times

3491
01:21:02,450 --> 01:21:02,460



3492
01:21:02,460 --> 01:21:08,930
and there is still the summation that

3493
01:21:08,930 --> 01:21:08,940



3494
01:21:08,940 --> 01:21:10,459
means when we the f I wanted to

3495
01:21:10,459 --> 01:21:10,469



3496
01:21:10,469 --> 01:21:13,880
actually always paint green

3497
01:21:18,820 --> NaN:NaN:NaN,NaN



3498
01:21:18,830 --> 01:21:21,979
that means when I now again by

3499
01:21:21,979 --> 01:21:21,989



3500
01:21:21,989 --> 01:21:24,620
the multiplicative commutative law here

3501
01:21:24,620 --> 01:21:24,630



3502
01:21:24,630 --> 01:21:32,959
rewrite it says the d psi m by dx j at p times

3503
01:21:32,959 --> 01:21:32,969



3504
01:21:32,969 --> 01:21:39,280
d by d psi m at p acting on f

3505
01:21:39,280 --> 01:21:39,290



3506
01:21:39,290 --> 01:21:41,030
yes and there you have your

3507
01:21:41,030 --> 01:21:41,040



3508
01:21:41,040 --> 01:21:47,330
transformation formula this this

3509
01:21:47,330 --> 01:21:47,340



3510
01:21:47,340 --> 01:21:51,290
object the j-th basis vector

3511
01:21:51,290 --> 01:21:51,300



3512
01:21:51,300 --> 01:21:52,700
let me write what this is

3513
01:21:52,700 --> 01:21:52,710



3514
01:21:52,710 --> 01:21:58,189
this is the j-th from the basis of the

3515
01:21:58,189 --> 01:21:58,199



3516
01:21:58,199 --> 01:22:03,580
chart sorry from the chart x

3517
01:22:03,580 --> 01:22:03,590



3518
01:22:03,590 --> 01:22:10,970
induced basis vector of which vector

3519
01:22:10,970 --> 01:22:10,980



3520
01:22:10,980 --> 01:22:14,209
space actually basis vector of

3521
01:22:14,209 --> 01:22:14,219



3522
01:22:14,219 --> 01:22:18,649
which vector space of the tangent

3523
01:22:18,649 --> 01:22:18,659



3524
01:22:18,659 --> 01:22:21,439
space at p and now comes the

3525
01:22:21,439 --> 01:22:21,449



3526
01:22:21,449 --> 01:22:22,760
equals sign equals sign

3527
01:22:22,760 --> 01:22:22,770



3528
01:22:22,770 --> 01:22:24,709
equals sign I have often pushed

3529
01:22:24,709 --> 01:22:24,719



3530
01:22:24,719 --> 01:22:26,479
to the right I have also pushed

3531
01:22:26,479 --> 01:22:26,489



3532
01:22:26,489 --> 01:22:27,939
it here to the right

3533
01:22:27,939 --> 01:22:27,949



3534
01:22:27,949 --> 01:22:32,200
this object the j-th basis vector

3535
01:22:32,200 --> 01:22:32,210



3536
01:22:32,210 --> 01:22:35,870
with respect to the chart x is given

3537
01:22:35,870 --> 01:22:35,880



3538
01:22:35,880 --> 01:22:40,340
by the sum over all m of the derivative

3539
01:22:40,340 --> 01:22:40,350



3540
01:22:40,350 --> 01:22:43,160
of this psi m by dx j that

3541
01:22:43,160 --> 01:22:43,170



3542
01:22:43,170 --> 01:22:45,410
may now go well that is just

3543
01:22:45,410 --> 01:22:45,420

3544
01:22:45,420 --> 01:22:47,090
nothing other than the j

3545
01:22:47,090 --> 01:22:47,100



3546
01:22:47,100 --> 01:22:48,979
the derivative in the j direction of the

3547
01:22:48,979 --> 01:22:48,989



3548
01:22:48,989 --> 01:22:50,540
basis change function of the m-th

3549
01:22:50,540 --> 01:22:50,550



3550
01:22:50,550 --> 01:22:52,130
component of the basis change function

3551
01:22:52,130 --> 01:22:52,140



3552
01:22:52,140 --> 01:22:54,770
that is quite easy to compute you must compute

3553
01:22:54,770 --> 01:22:54,780



3554
01:22:54,780 --> 01:22:56,800
that and then possibly all

3555
01:22:56,800 --> 01:22:56,810



3556
01:22:56,810 --> 01:23:00,260
basis vectors in

3557
01:23:00,260 --> 01:23:00,270



3558
01:23:00,270 --> 01:23:03,740
the psi basis enter and so you can express the

3559
01:23:03,740 --> 01:23:03,750



3560
01:23:03,750 --> 01:23:05,870
basis vector in the x basis in terms of

3561
01:23:05,870 --> 01:23:05,880



3562
01:23:05,880 --> 01:23:07,170
the psi basis

3563
01:23:07,170 --> 01:23:07,180



3564
01:23:07,180 --> 01:23:10,200
with our definition the whole

3565
01:23:10,200 --> 01:23:10,210



3566
01:23:10,210 --> 01:23:11,310
computation is only an exercise in

3567
01:23:11,310 --> 01:23:11,320



3568
01:23:11,320 --> 01:23:13,610
multidimensional chain rule plus

3569
01:23:13,610 --> 01:23:13,620



3570
01:23:13,620 --> 01:23:18,420
definition of this object I have

3571
01:23:18,420 --> 01:23:18,430



3572
01:23:18,430 --> 01:23:20,730
given you that you must hammer

3573
01:23:20,730 --> 01:23:20,740



3574
01:23:20,740 --> 01:23:23,940
that into yourself at home and then it

3575
01:23:23,940 --> 01:23:23,950



3576
01:23:23,950 --> 01:23:26,190
goes no further but it is quite simple ok

3577
01:23:26,190 --> 01:23:26,200



3578
01:23:26,200 --> 01:23:29,250
only looks bad so now we have

3579
01:23:29,250 --> 01:23:29,260



3580
01:23:29,260 --> 01:23:31,320
that

3581
01:23:39,330 --> NaN:NaN:NaN,NaN



3582
01:23:39,340 --> 01:23:41,910
after we have that the whole

3583
01:23:41,910 --> 01:23:41,920



3584
01:23:41,920 --> 01:23:45,690
remaining task is no problem at all anymore

3585
01:23:49,040 --> NaN:NaN:NaN,NaN



3586
01:23:49,050 --> 01:23:51,180
we simply start now on the

3587
01:23:51,180 --> 01:23:51,190



3588
01:23:51,190 --> 01:23:54,000
right side and end on the

3589
01:23:54,000 --> 01:23:54,010



3590
01:23:54,010 --> 01:23:59,300
left side so we write x j

3591
01:23:59,300 --> 01:23:59,310



3592
01:23:59,310 --> 01:24:05,250
differentiated by lambda at lambda zero times

3593
01:24:05,250 --> 01:24:05,260



3594
01:24:05,260 --> 01:24:11,370
d by dx j at the point equals we

3595
01:24:11,370 --> 01:24:11,380



3596
01:24:11,380 --> 01:24:16,290
take here our result dollar that

3597
01:24:16,290 --> 01:24:16,300



3598
01:24:16,300 --> 01:24:19,169
is our result dollar because it is so

3599
01:24:19,169 --> 01:24:19,179



3600
01:24:19,179 --> 01:24:23,430
valuable and substitute that is

3601
01:24:23,430 --> 01:24:23,440



3602
01:24:23,440 --> 01:24:27,959
x j derived by gamma prime at the point

3603
01:24:27,959 --> 01:24:27,969



3604
01:24:27,969 --> 01:24:31,439
lambda zero x yes good what comes out that

3605
01:24:31,439 --> 01:24:31,449



3606
01:24:31,449 --> 01:24:37,709
can almost be done in head d by d psi m at p but

3607
01:24:37,709 --> 01:24:37,719



3608
01:24:37,719 --> 01:24:39,270
quasi with the correction

3609
01:24:39,270 --> 01:24:39,280



3610
01:24:39,280 --> 01:24:46,399
d psi m by dx j

3611
01:24:46,399 --> 01:24:46,409



3612
01:24:46,409 --> 01:24:50,750
these are all real multiplications

3613
01:24:50,750 --> 01:24:50,760



3614
01:24:50,760 --> 01:24:52,830
now made some nonsense but

3615
01:24:52,830 --> 01:24:52,840



3616
01:24:52,840 --> 01:24:56,839
everything is correct so and this thing here

3617
01:24:56,839 --> 01:24:56,849



3618
01:24:56,849 --> 01:24:59,790
is but according to the above after the red

3619
01:24:59,790 --> 01:24:59,800



3620
01:24:59,800 --> 01:25:05,939
equals signs from above we can

3621
01:25:05,939 --> 01:25:05,949



3622
01:25:05,949 --> 01:25:08,580
compute far below here it equals

3623
01:25:08,580 --> 01:25:08,590



3624
01:25:08,590 --> 01:25:13,709
psi m derived by lambda at the

3625
01:25:13,709 --> 01:25:13,719



3626
01:25:13,719 --> 01:25:17,570
point so derived at the point 0

3627
01:25:17,570 --> 01:25:17,580



3628
01:25:17,580 --> 01:25:26,939
d by d psi j at p okay so now

3629
01:25:26,939 --> 01:25:26,949



3630
01:25:26,949 --> 01:25:28,830
one can at most still make an error

3631
01:25:28,830 --> 01:25:28,840



3632
01:25:28,840 --> 01:25:30,919


3633
01:25:30,919 --> 01:25:30,929



3634
01:25:30,929 --> 01:25:33,030
one cannot make an error but one

3635
01:25:33,030 --> 01:25:33,040



3636
01:25:33,040 --> 01:25:34,140
can do something clever

3637
01:25:34,140 --> 01:25:34,150



3638
01:25:34,150 --> 01:25:38,430
one can one wants now quasi to compare the side

3639
01:25:38,430 --> 01:25:38,440



3640
01:25:38,440 --> 01:25:41,370
with the side and best

3641
01:25:41,370 --> 01:25:41,380



3642
01:25:41,380 --> 01:25:43,320
one does such a thing okay I see how it works with

3643
01:25:43,320 --> 01:25:43,330



3644
01:25:43,330 --> 01:25:44,760
the basis best

3645
01:25:44,760 --> 01:25:44,770



3646
01:25:44,770 --> 01:25:47,040
one does such a thing by subtracting one side from

3647
01:25:47,040 --> 01:25:47,050



3648
01:25:47,050 --> 01:25:48,240
the other

3649
01:25:48,240 --> 01:25:48,250



3650
01:25:48,250 --> 01:25:50,370
ok I have an equation written here

3651
01:25:50,370 --> 01:25:50,380



3652
01:25:50,380 --> 01:25:51,100
this

3653
01:25:51,100 --> 01:25:51,110



3654
01:25:51,110 --> 01:25:56,200
equals this thing from this follows I

3655
01:25:56,200 --> 01:25:56,210



3656
01:25:56,210 --> 01:25:58,210
now take the right side to the left

3657
01:25:58,210 --> 01:25:58,220



3658
01:25:58,220 --> 01:26:00,250
and at the end it stands equals

3659
01:26:00,250 --> 01:26:00,260



3660
01:26:00,260 --> 01:26:02,200
zero so I write equals

3661
01:26:02,200 --> 01:26:02,210



3662
01:26:02,210 --> 01:26:02,980
equals zero

3663
01:26:02,980 --> 01:26:02,990



3664
01:26:02,990 --> 01:26:05,440
now comes this side there now stands psi

3665
01:26:05,440 --> 01:26:05,450



3666
01:26:05,450 --> 01:26:11,350
j derived by gamma prime of lambda zero times d

3667
01:26:11,350 --> 01:26:11,360



3668
01:26:11,360 --> 01:26:14,680
by d psi j at the point

3669
01:26:14,680 --> 01:26:14,690



3670
01:26:14,690 --> 01:26:18,670
this is that minus the other side x j derived by

3671
01:26:18,670 --> 01:26:18,680



3672
01:26:18,680 --> 01:26:21,580
gamma prime at the point lambda zero

3673
01:26:21,580 --> 01:26:21,590



3674
01:26:21,590 --> 01:26:28,390
d psi by dx j at p and once more

3675
01:26:28,390 --> 01:26:28,400



3676
01:26:28,400 --> 01:26:32,800
d by d psi m at p

3677
01:26:32,800 --> 01:26:32,810



3678
01:26:32,810 --> 01:26:35,710
so far so good and I would so much like

3679
01:26:35,710 --> 01:26:35,720



3680
01:26:35,720 --> 01:26:38,020
I would that the most active

3681
01:26:38,020 --> 01:26:38,030



3682
01:26:38,030 --> 01:26:40,000
j stands there the m-th

3683
01:26:40,000 --> 01:26:40,010



3684
01:26:40,010 --> 01:26:43,240
I would so much like to factor out this d by d psi

3685
01:26:43,240 --> 01:26:43,250



3686
01:26:43,250 --> 01:26:45,940
something but it does not work

3687
01:26:45,940 --> 01:26:45,950



3688
01:26:45,950 --> 01:26:47,560
because here stands the j and there stands the

3689
01:26:47,560 --> 01:26:47,570



3690
01:26:47,570 --> 01:26:50,260
m-th yes good but in between is a

3691
01:26:50,260 --> 01:26:50,270



3692
01:26:50,270 --> 01:26:52,540
mere minus sign here in front the j

3693
01:26:52,540 --> 01:26:52,550



3694
01:26:52,550 --> 01:26:54,550
is summed over that I can

3695
01:26:54,550 --> 01:26:54,560



3696
01:26:54,560 --> 01:26:56,920
rename I can simply call the summation

3697
01:26:56,920 --> 01:26:56,930



3698
01:26:56,930 --> 01:26:59,410
index j simply m

3699
01:26:59,410 --> 01:26:59,420



3700
01:26:59,420 --> 01:27:02,140
or it is still summed the same way there

3701
01:27:02,140 --> 01:27:02,150



3702
01:27:02,150 --> 01:27:04,420
are the index then one can simply do so

3703
01:27:04,420 --> 01:27:04,430



3704
01:27:04,430 --> 01:27:07,450
and now I can but this part here

3705
01:27:07,450 --> 01:27:07,460



3706
01:27:07,460 --> 01:27:09,250
that appears in both

3707
01:27:09,250 --> 01:27:09,260



3708
01:27:09,260 --> 01:27:11,500
that I cannot factor out so I make

3709
01:27:11,500 --> 01:27:11,510



3710
01:27:11,510 --> 01:27:14,100
a big bracket bracket this thing

3711
01:27:14,100 --> 01:27:14,110



3712
01:27:14,110 --> 01:27:18,670
out yes when factored out it is here

3713
01:27:18,670 --> 01:27:18,680



3714
01:27:18,680 --> 01:27:20,830
no longer there because it now stands

3715
01:27:20,830 --> 01:27:20,840



3716
01:26:20,840 --> 01:27:23,170
at the end

3717
01:27:26,720 --> NaN:NaN:NaN,NaN



3718
01:27:26,730 --> 01:27:34,990
or so d by d psi m is the basis

3719
01:27:34,990 --> 01:27:35,000



3720
01:27:35,000 --> 01:27:39,730
what stands here this stands 0 equals

3721
01:27:39,730 --> 01:27:39,740



3722
01:27:39,740 --> 01:27:42,230
some coefficients some

3723
01:27:42,230 --> 01:27:42,240



3724
01:27:42,240 --> 01:27:47,120
green coefficients times d by d

3725
01:27:47,120 --> 01:27:47,130



3726
01:27:47,130 --> 01:27:49,460
psi m and if the d's by are

3727
01:27:49,460 --> 01:27:49,470



3728
01:27:49,470 --> 01:27:51,590
a basis if they are linearly independent

3729
01:27:51,590 --> 01:27:51,600



3730
01:27:51,600 --> 01:27:53,570
that means for arbitrary coefficients

3731
01:27:53,570 --> 01:27:53,580



3732
01:27:53,580 --> 01:27:55,550
this sum can only be 0 if the

3733
01:27:55,550 --> 01:27:55,560



3734
01:27:55,560 --> 01:27:58,160
green bracket is 0 for every value of

3735
01:27:58,160 --> 01:27:58,170



3736
01:27:58,170 --> 01:28:07,150
m right since d by d psi 1

3737
01:28:07,150 --> 01:28:07,160



3738
01:28:07,160 --> 01:28:16,150
at p to d by d psi m at p are a basis

3739
01:28:16,150 --> 01:28:16,160



3740
01:28:16,160 --> 01:28:20,170
in particular linearly independent

3741
01:28:20,170 --> 01:28:20,180



3742
01:28:20,180 --> 01:28:27,280
in particular linearly independent

3743
01:28:27,280 --> 01:28:27,290



3744
01:28:27,290 --> 01:28:36,350
it follows from this that the bracket is 0

3745
01:28:36,350 --> 01:28:36,360



3746
01:28:36,360 --> 01:28:38,870
but I can also write that psi

3747
01:28:38,870 --> 01:28:38,880



3748
01:28:38,880 --> 01:28:44,360
composed with gamma the component of the curve in

3749
01:28:44,360 --> 01:28:44,370



3750
01:28:44,370 --> 01:28:46,930
the psi chart at point lambda zero

3751
01:28:46,930 --> 01:28:46,940



3752
01:28:46,940 --> 01:28:54,850
differentiated is the same as d psi

3753
01:28:54,850 --> 01:28:54,860



3754
01:28:54,860 --> 01:29:05,420
by dx x I just had logging

3755
01:29:05,420 --> 01:29:05,430



3756
01:29:05,430 --> 01:29:08,390
man now I must

3757
01:29:08,390 --> 01:29:08,400



3758
01:29:08,400 --> 01:29:10,010
be careful what is now here on it

3759
01:29:10,010 --> 01:29:10,020



3760
01:29:10,020 --> 01:29:11,540
have called this j exactly so is

3761
01:29:11,540 --> 01:29:11,550



3762
01:29:11,550 --> 01:29:12,980
it here stands that could namely not

3763
01:29:12,980 --> 01:29:12,990



3764
01:29:12,990 --> 01:29:15,910
be right anymore here stands x j

3765
01:29:15,910 --> 01:29:15,920



3766
01:29:15,920 --> 01:29:20,810
derived at point lambda zero

3767
01:29:20,810 --> 01:29:20,820



3768
01:29:20,820 --> 01:29:23,510
so what were these these were the

3769
01:29:23,510 --> 01:29:23,520



3770
01:29:23,520 --> 01:29:24,890
components I now write them

3771
01:29:24,890 --> 01:29:24,900



3772
01:29:24,900 --> 01:29:25,840
a bit shorter

3773
01:29:25,840 --> 01:29:25,850



3774
01:29:25,850 --> 01:29:29,270
these are the components here which we

3775
01:29:29,270 --> 01:29:29,280



3776
01:29:29,280 --> 01:29:32,750
have called prime is the

3777
01:29:32,750 --> 01:29:32,760



3778
01:29:32,760 --> 01:29:35,450
derivative the point I leave out

3779
01:29:35,450 --> 01:29:35,460



3780
01:29:35,460 --> 01:29:38,720
the m-th component in this corner

3781
01:29:38,720 --> 01:29:38,730



3782
01:29:38,730 --> 01:29:40,310
one could say these are the

3783
01:29:40,310 --> 01:29:40,320



3784
01:29:40,320 --> 01:29:43,100
component functions of the x chart and

3785
01:29:43,100 --> 01:29:43,110



3786
01:29:43,110 --> 01:29:44,420
these things there we want to call

3787
01:29:44,420 --> 01:29:44,430



3788
01:29:44,430 --> 01:29:46,880
the m-th component but now in the psi

3789
01:29:46,880 --> 01:29:46,890



3790
01:29:46,890 --> 01:29:51,170
chart of the curve differentiated and this here

3791
01:29:51,170 --> 01:29:51,180



3792
01:29:51,180 --> 01:29:54,140
is the mediating map d psi m by

3793
01:29:54,140 --> 01:29:54,150



3794
01:29:54,150 --> 01:29:57,160
dx at p

3795
01:29:57,160 --> 01:29:57,170



3796
01:29:57,170 --> 01:30:00,410
and this is the transformation formula

3797
01:30:00,410 --> 01:30:00,420



3798
01:30:00,420 --> 01:30:08,660
for components of the velocity

3799
01:30:08,660 --> 01:30:08,670



3800
01:30:08,670 --> 01:30:17,320
vector transformation formula for

3801
01:30:17,320 --> 01:30:17,330



3802
01:30:17,330 --> 01:30:25,190
components of the tangent vector

3803
01:30:27,100 --> NaN:NaN:NaN,NaN



3804
01:30:27,110 --> 01:30:30,110
namely transformation under the

3805
01:30:30,110 --> 01:30:30,120



3806
01:30:30,120 --> 01:30:33,739
transformation under chart changes

3807
01:30:45,100 --> NaN:NaN:NaN,NaN



3808
01:30:45,110 --> 01:30:48,399
so once again suppose someone tells you

3809
01:30:48,399 --> 01:30:48,409



3810
01:30:48,409 --> 01:30:50,320
I give you the

3811
01:30:50,320 --> 01:30:50,330



3812
01:30:50,330 --> 01:30:55,300
velocity vector 237 it has the

3813
01:30:55,300 --> 01:30:55,310



3814
01:30:55,310 --> 01:30:58,990
components 237 but these components

3815
01:30:58,990 --> 01:30:59,000



3816
01:30:59,000 --> 01:31:01,270
refer to the such-and-such to the

3817
01:31:01,270 --> 01:31:01,280



3818
01:31:01,280 --> 01:31:03,120
such-and-such chart

3819
01:31:03,120 --> 01:31:03,130



3820
01:31:03,130 --> 01:31:06,340
the area of the coordinate system and

3821
01:31:06,340 --> 01:31:06,350



3822
01:31:06,350 --> 01:31:09,090
says to him now we do however a

3823
01:31:09,090 --> 01:31:09,100



3824
01:31:09,100 --> 01:31:12,939
chart change map over to the

3825
01:31:12,939 --> 01:31:12,949



3826
01:31:12,949 --> 01:31:14,950
other chart that is coded in here

3827
01:31:14,950 --> 01:31:14,960



3828
01:31:14,960 --> 01:31:16,240
and is already from this chart

3829
01:31:16,240 --> 01:31:16,250



3830
01:31:16,250 --> 01:31:20,020
change map and then the

3831
01:31:20,020 --> 01:31:20,030



3832
01:31:20,030 --> 01:31:22,600
components the m-th component of the

3833
01:31:22,600 --> 01:31:22,610



3834
01:31:22,610 --> 01:31:24,609
velocity vector in the new

3835
01:31:24,609 --> 01:31:24,619



3836
01:31:24,619 --> 01:31:27,700
is then given via the summation over

3837
01:31:27,700 --> 01:31:27,710



3838
01:31:27,710 --> 01:31:31,240
all the old ones so the first

3839
01:31:31,240 --> 01:31:31,250



3840
01:31:31,250 --> 01:31:32,680
component of the velocity in the

3841
01:31:32,680 --> 01:31:32,690



3842
01:31:32,690 --> 01:31:35,620
new chart depends on all

3843
01:31:35,620 --> 01:31:35,630



3844
01:31:35,630 --> 01:31:37,359
components of the velocity in the

3845
01:31:37,359 --> 01:31:37,369



3846
01:31:37,369 --> 01:31:40,090
old chart by means of a at this

3847
01:31:40,090 --> 01:31:40,100



3848
01:31:40,100 --> 01:31:42,580
point linear map namely this

3849
01:31:42,580 --> 01:31:42,590



3850
01:31:42,590 --> 01:31:44,320
linear apart has two indices a

3851
01:31:44,320 --> 01:31:44,330



3852
01:31:44,330 --> 01:31:49,030
matrix is a linear map

3853
01:31:52,919 --> NaN:NaN:NaN,NaN



3854
01:31:52,929 --> 01:31:55,990
of course not because this j you mean

3855
01:31:55,990 --> 01:31:56,000



3856
01:31:56,000 --> 01:31:58,780
here still I can also never just copy

3857
01:31:58,780 --> 01:31:58,790



3858
01:31:58,790 --> 01:32:01,450
because every index that appears double

3859
01:32:01,450 --> 01:32:01,460



3860
01:32:01,460 --> 01:32:03,669
is summed over and what I

3861
01:32:03,669 --> 01:32:03,679



3862
01:32:03,679 --> 01:32:05,379
call it when summing does not matter you

3863
01:32:05,379 --> 01:32:05,389



3864
01:32:05,389 --> 01:32:07,060
must only avoid conflicts you

3865
01:32:07,060 --> 01:32:07,070



3866
01:32:07,070 --> 01:32:08,530
cannot have five indices with the

3867
01:32:08,530 --> 01:32:08,540



3868
01:32:08,540 --> 01:32:10,689
same name in a sack in

3869
01:32:10,689 --> 01:32:10,699



3870
01:32:10,699 --> 01:32:12,939
a product yes so should always only

3871
01:32:12,939 --> 01:32:12,949



3872
01:32:12,949 --> 01:32:14,859
have at most two with the same name

3873
01:32:14,859 --> 01:32:14,869



3874
01:32:14,869 --> 01:32:15,970
over those is then summed and the

3875
01:32:15,970 --> 01:32:15,980



3876
01:32:15,980 --> 01:32:17,979
others are free and when one does

3877
01:32:17,979 --> 01:32:17,989



3878
01:32:17,989 --> 01:32:19,780
such calculations it often happens one has

3879
01:32:19,780 --> 01:32:19,790



3880
01:32:19,790 --> 01:32:21,609
one part somewhere right one part

3881
01:32:21,609 --> 01:32:21,619



3882
01:32:21,619 --> 01:32:23,050
and then one puts the parts together

3883
01:32:23,050 --> 01:32:23,060



3884
01:32:23,060 --> 01:32:25,540
then there are index conflicts and these

3885
01:32:25,540 --> 01:32:25,550



3886
01:32:25,550 --> 01:32:27,669
index conflicts one must always resolve

3887
01:32:27,669 --> 01:32:27,679



3888
01:32:27,679 --> 01:32:30,160
by renaming summation indices over which

3889
01:32:30,160 --> 01:32:30,170



3890
01:32:30,170 --> 01:32:32,350
one sums by renaming them

3891
01:32:32,350 --> 01:32:32,360



3892
01:32:32,360 --> 01:32:34,120
with indices that one has not used

3893
01:32:34,120 --> 01:32:34,130



3894
01:32:34,130 --> 01:32:40,990
but that is quite logical ok so

3895
01:32:40,990 --> 01:32:41,000



3896
01:32:41,000 --> 01:32:43,300
this calculation so the calculation from

3897
01:32:43,300 --> 01:32:43,310



3898
01:32:43,310 --> 01:32:43,959
today

3899
01:32:43,959 --> 01:32:43,969



3900
01:32:43,969 --> 01:32:46,510
these are essentially important this runs in

3901
01:32:46,510 --> 01:32:46,520



3902
01:32:46,520 --> 01:32:48,609
the standard mechanics books under the

3903
01:32:48,609 --> 01:32:48,619



3904
01:32:48,619 --> 01:32:51,840
term generalized coordinates and

3905
01:32:51,840 --> 01:32:51,850



3906
01:32:51,850 --> 01:32:53,000
generalized

3907
01:32:53,000 --> 01:32:53,010



3908
01:32:53,010 --> 01:32:55,250
velocities you find this

3909
01:32:55,250 --> 01:32:55,260



3910
01:32:55,260 --> 01:32:56,930
normally in the tenth lecture

3911
01:32:56,930 --> 01:32:56,940



3912
01:32:56,940 --> 01:32:59,149
in mechanics yes we are here in the

3913
01:32:59,149 --> 01:32:59,159



3914
01:32:59,159 --> 01:33:01,129
fourth but who quasi pushes all the conceptual

3915
01:33:01,129 --> 01:33:01,139



3916
01:33:01,139 --> 01:33:02,720
things to the front

3917
01:33:02,720 --> 01:33:02,730



3918
01:33:02,730 --> 01:33:03,890
so that we know what we are

3919
01:33:03,890 --> 01:33:03,900



3920
01:33:03,900 --> 01:33:06,379
talking about yes but this is what one calls

3921
01:33:06,379 --> 01:33:06,389



3922
01:33:06,389 --> 01:33:08,689
generalized velocities and that

3923
01:33:08,689 --> 01:33:08,699



3924
01:33:08,699 --> 01:33:11,140
would be the change of the generalized

3925
01:33:11,140 --> 01:33:11,150



3926
01:33:11,150 --> 01:33:13,069
velocities under change of the

3927
01:33:13,069 --> 01:33:13,079



3928
01:33:13,079 --> 01:33:15,290
generalized coordinates that is how one would

3929
01:33:15,290 --> 01:33:15,300



3930
01:33:15,300 --> 01:33:16,910
call it in the standard mechanics book

3931
01:33:16,910 --> 01:33:16,920



3932
01:33:16,920 --> 01:33:19,100
but this is really the full

3933
01:33:19,100 --> 01:33:19,110



3934
01:33:19,110 --> 01:33:21,950
information when you have understood

3935
01:33:21,950 --> 01:33:21,960



3936
01:33:21,960 --> 01:33:24,319
this and I must demand

3937
01:33:24,319 --> 01:33:24,329



3938
01:33:24,329 --> 01:33:26,509
this from you when you have understood this

3939
01:33:26,509 --> 01:33:26,519



3940
01:33:26,519 --> 01:33:28,189
nobody can fool you anymore there are

3941
01:33:28,189 --> 01:33:28,199



3942
01:33:28,199 --> 01:33:29,959
no more ambiguities and that is why

3943
01:33:29,959 --> 01:33:29,969



3944
01:33:29,969 --> 01:33:34,370
we do it this way yes good another question

3945
01:33:34,370 --> 01:33:34,380



3946
01:33:34,380 --> 01:33:39,080
so far I may also again

3947
01:33:39,080 --> 01:33:39,090



3948
01:33:39,090 --> 01:33:40,430
encourage you I had written that in an email

3949
01:33:40,430 --> 01:33:40,440



3950
01:33:40,440 --> 01:33:41,089


3951
01:33:41,089 --> 01:33:41,099



3952
01:33:41,099 --> 01:33:43,160
until now nobody was with me after

3953
01:33:43,160 --> 01:33:43,170



3954
01:33:43,170 --> 01:33:44,540
the lecture said let us go

3955
01:33:44,540 --> 01:33:44,550



3956
01:33:44,550 --> 01:33:46,390
to the office or some little group

3957
01:33:46,390 --> 01:33:46,400



3958
01:33:46,400 --> 01:33:49,100
and somehow ask questions about physics

3959
01:33:49,100 --> 01:33:49,110



3960
01:33:49,110 --> 01:33:51,680
talk about mathematics after the lecture there is

3961
01:33:51,680 --> 01:33:51,690



3962
01:33:51,690 --> 01:33:53,899
always well almost always opportunity for that

3963
01:33:53,899 --> 01:33:53,909



3964
01:33:53,909 --> 01:33:55,100
then it is probably bad for

3965
01:33:55,100 --> 01:33:55,110



3966
01:33:55,110 --> 01:33:56,930
you because you have exercises early but

3967
01:33:56,930 --> 01:33:56,940



3968
01:33:56,940 --> 01:33:58,520
Tuesdays is no question at all

3969
01:33:58,520 --> 01:33:58,530



3970
01:33:58,530 --> 01:33:59,689
do that actually with all

3971
01:33:59,689 --> 01:33:59,699



3972
01:33:59,699 --> 01:34:00,979
lectures it has always been like this plaster and

3973
01:34:00,979 --> 01:34:00,989



3974
01:34:00,989 --> 01:34:02,209
crutches we go to the office and then

3975
01:34:02,209 --> 01:34:02,219



3976
01:34:02,219 --> 01:34:05,060
one talks and there you learn more than in

3977
01:34:05,060 --> 01:34:05,070



3978
01:34:05,070 --> 01:34:06,169
many hours that you spend

3979
01:34:06,169 --> 01:34:06,179



3980
01:34:06,179 --> 01:34:09,290
alone ok dare to come I wanted

3981
01:34:09,290 --> 01:34:09,300



3982
01:34:09,300 --> 01:34:10,100
to talk about that

3983
01:34:10,100 --> 01:34:10,110



3984
01:34:10,110 --> 01:34:14,179
okay it continues

3985
01:34:30,620 --> NaN:NaN:NaN,NaN



3986
01:34:30,630 --> 01:34:33,590
we introduce another concept of

3987
01:34:33,590 --> 01:34:33,600



3988
01:34:33,600 --> 01:34:37,160
greatest importance and for that there

3989
01:34:37,160 --> 01:34:37,170



3990
01:34:37,170 --> 01:34:38,209
are also again exercises where much

3991
01:34:38,209 --> 01:34:38,219



3992
01:34:38,219 --> 01:34:44,330
will become clear to you cotangent spaces

3993
01:34:47,890 --> NaN:NaN:NaN,NaN



3994
01:34:47,900 --> 01:34:55,610
so you know this from mathematics

3995
01:34:55,610 --> 01:34:55,620



3996
01:34:55,620 --> 01:34:57,379
mathematics tells you when you

3997
01:34:57,379 --> 01:34:57,389



3998
01:34:57,389 --> 01:35:01,970
have a vector space V when you have

4000
01:35:01,970 --> 01:35:01,980



4001
01:35:01,980 --> 01:35:04,850
a vector space V then you can

4002
01:35:04,850 --> 01:35:04,860



4003
01:35:04,860 --> 01:35:07,340
first form a set and this

4004
01:35:07,340 --> 01:35:07,350



4005
01:35:07,350 --> 01:35:11,840
set you call V star and that

4006
01:35:11,840 --> 01:35:11,850



4007
01:35:11,850 --> 01:35:13,370
is a very simple set

4008
01:35:13,370 --> 01:35:13,380



4009
01:35:13,380 --> 01:35:15,740
it contains namely all linear

4010
01:35:15,740 --> 01:35:15,750



4011
01:35:15,750 --> 01:35:18,800
maps from V into the base field in

4012
01:35:18,800 --> 01:35:18,810



4013
01:35:18,810 --> 01:35:19,760
this case the reals

4014
01:35:19,760 --> 01:35:19,770



4015
01:35:19,770 --> 01:35:22,430
when I put an arrow with tilde over it

4016
01:35:22,430 --> 01:35:22,440



4017
01:35:22,440 --> 01:35:23,720
I always mean

4018
01:35:23,720 --> 01:35:23,730



4019
01:35:23,730 --> 01:35:25,790
linear map so all maps

4020
01:35:25,790 --> 01:35:25,800



4021
01:35:25,800 --> 01:35:28,160
that are a linear map

4022
01:35:28,160 --> 01:35:28,170



4023
01:35:28,170 --> 01:35:32,330
what was again a linear map

4024
01:35:32,770 --> NaN:NaN:NaN,NaN



4025
01:35:32,780 --> 01:35:37,780
well that was phi of v plus phi of w

4026
01:35:37,780 --> 01:35:37,790



4027
01:35:37,790 --> 01:35:41,330
and also but phi of v plus w is

4028
01:35:41,330 --> 01:35:41,340



4029
01:35:41,340 --> 01:35:44,240
equal to phi of v plus phi of w you

4030
01:35:44,240 --> 01:35:44,250



4031
01:35:44,250 --> 01:35:46,220
can so first map first

4032
01:35:46,220 --> 01:35:46,230



4033
01:35:46,230 --> 01:35:47,660
transform and then map or first

4034
01:35:47,670 --> 01:35:48,979
map then sum it should come out

4035
01:35:48,979 --> 01:35:48,989



4036
01:35:48,989 --> 01:35:50,990
the same is the first property

4037
01:35:50,990 --> 01:35:51,000



4038
01:35:51,000 --> 01:35:52,910
the second is that under scalings

4039
01:35:52,910 --> 01:35:52,920



4040
01:35:52,920 --> 01:35:56,390
lambda times that you can then also first

4041
01:35:56,390 --> 01:35:56,400



4042
01:35:56,400 --> 01:35:59,120
map and then scale that

4043
01:35:59,120 --> 01:35:59,130



4044
01:35:59,130 --> 01:36:01,729
was linear and whenever I do not want

4045
01:36:01,729 --> 01:36:01,739



4046
01:36:01,739 --> 01:36:03,080
to write it like this I simply make

4047
01:36:03,080 --> 01:36:03,090



4048
01:36:03,090 --> 01:36:05,899
a small tilde ok linear

4049
01:36:05,899 --> 01:36:05,909



4050
01:36:05,909 --> 01:36:08,180
map so you form a set of all

4051
01:36:08,180 --> 01:36:08,190



4052
01:36:08,190 --> 01:36:10,129
linear maps from this vector

4053
01:36:10,129 --> 01:36:10,139



4054
01:36:10,139 --> 01:36:12,050
space into the real numbers nothing

4055
01:36:12,050 --> 01:36:12,060



4056
01:36:12,060 --> 01:36:14,750
simpler than that and now you equip

4057
01:36:14,750 --> 01:36:14,760



4058
01:36:14,760 --> 01:36:16,939
it and you already guess with what we

4059
01:36:16,939 --> 01:36:16,949



4060
01:36:16,949 --> 01:36:18,830
have a space of maps we

4061
01:36:18,830 --> 01:36:18,840



4062
01:36:18,840 --> 01:36:20,780
equip it with an addition and

4063
01:36:20,780 --> 01:36:20,790



4064
01:36:20,790 --> 01:36:22,250
a scaling also called scalar

4065
01:36:22,250 --> 01:36:22,260



4066
01:36:22,260 --> 01:36:24,410
multiplication I will

4067
01:36:24,410 --> 01:36:24,420



4068
01:36:24,420 --> 01:36:25,939
not write those down for the world

4069
01:36:25,939 --> 01:36:25,949



4070
01:36:25,949 --> 01:36:27,680
that would be the flower plus and

4071
01:36:27,680 --> 01:36:27,690



4072
01:36:27,690 --> 01:36:29,810
flower times so flower plus and

4073
01:36:29,810 --> 01:36:29,820



4074
01:36:29,820 --> 01:36:32,890
flower times are again the pointwise

4075
01:36:32,890 --> 01:36:32,900



4076
01:36:32,900 --> 01:36:35,840
defined from the real numbers

4077
01:36:35,840 --> 01:36:35,850



4078
01:36:35,850 --> 01:36:38,720
inherited addition because we have maps

4079
01:36:38,720 --> 01:36:38,730



4080
01:36:38,730 --> 01:36:41,360
and this thing but only

4081
01:36:41,360 --> 01:36:41,370



4082
01:36:41,370 --> 01:36:44,230
equipped with this is again a vector

4083
01:36:44,230 --> 01:36:44,240



4084
01:36:44,240 --> 01:36:46,910
if the vector space V is finite dimensional

4085
01:36:46,910 --> 01:36:46,920



4086
01:36:46,920 --> 01:36:48,080
it also has the same dimension

4087
01:36:48,080 --> 01:36:48,090



4088
01:36:48,090 --> 01:36:51,160
and so on and so forth

4089
01:36:51,160 --> 01:36:51,170



4090
01:36:51,170 --> 01:36:54,130
this thing is called the dual vector space

4091
01:36:54,130 --> 01:36:54,140



4092
01:36:54,140 --> 01:37:02,840
called dual vector space or also co-vector

4093
01:37:02,840 --> 01:37:02,850



4094
01:37:02,850 --> 01:37:05,110
space

4095
01:37:05,110 --> 01:37:05,120



4096
01:37:05,120 --> 01:37:08,950
well vector space

4097
01:37:08,950 --> 01:37:08,960



4098
01:37:08,960 --> 01:37:11,690
we actually always want to call it co-space

4099
01:37:11,690 --> 01:37:11,700



4100
01:37:11,700 --> 01:37:14,930
it is namely the companion of

4101
01:37:14,930 --> 01:37:14,940



4102
01:37:14,940 --> 01:37:20,990
the one so says mathematics yes what

4103
01:37:20,990 --> 01:37:21,000



4104
01:37:21,000 --> 01:37:23,720
do we do with it now

4105
01:37:23,830 --> NaN:NaN:NaN,NaN



4106
01:37:23,840 --> 01:37:26,090
we have so far only one vector we

4107
01:37:26,090 --> 01:37:26,100



4108
01:37:26,100 --> 01:37:28,610
have constructed several but we

4109
01:37:28,610 --> 01:37:28,620



4110
01:37:28,620 --> 01:37:34,730
use identically the tangent space

4111
01:37:34,730 --> 01:37:34,740



4112
01:37:34,740 --> 01:37:36,680
at a certain point so we have

4113
01:37:36,680 --> 01:37:36,690



4114
01:37:36,690 --> 01:37:37,970
at a point of the manifold

4115
01:37:37,970 --> 01:37:37,980



4116
01:37:37,980 --> 01:37:40,400
defined a tangent space what do

4117
01:37:40,400 --> 01:37:40,410



4118
01:37:40,410 --> 01:37:43,330
we do now we also consider the

4119
01:37:43,330 --> 01:37:43,340



4120
01:37:43,340 --> 01:37:46,540
corresponding cotangent space

4121
01:37:46,540 --> 01:37:46,550



4122
01:37:46,550 --> 01:37:48,890
these are all linear maps

4123
01:37:48,890 --> 01:37:48,900



4124
01:37:48,900 --> 01:37:50,060
let me write it down

4125
01:37:50,060 --> 01:37:50,070



4126
01:37:50,070 --> 01:37:53,210
this cotangent space which had

4127
01:37:53,210 --> 01:37:53,220



4128
01:37:53,220 --> 01:37:56,120
a star up here and that must then

4129
01:37:56,120 --> 01:37:56,130



4130
01:37:56,130 --> 01:37:57,740
probably be the space of all and it is also

4131
01:37:57,740 --> 01:37:57,750



4132
01:37:57,750 --> 01:38:00,670
a linear map which

4133
01:38:00,670 --> 01:38:00,680



4134
01:38:00,680 --> 01:38:03,200
eats tangent vectors and in

4135
01:38:03,200 --> 01:38:03,210



4136
01:38:03,210 --> 01:38:05,390
linear fashion makes from them a real number

4137
01:38:05,390 --> 01:38:05,400



4138
01:38:05,400 --> 01:38:06,490


4139
01:38:06,490 --> 01:38:06,500



4140
01:38:06,500 --> 01:38:12,800
and because we are of course lazy we save

4141
01:38:12,800 --> 01:38:12,810



4142
01:38:12,810 --> 01:38:15,140
ourselves the brackets and write the

4143
01:38:15,140 --> 01:38:15,150



4144
01:38:15,150 --> 01:38:17,000
star there so do not be surprised if the

4145
01:38:17,000 --> 01:38:17,010



4146
01:38:17,010 --> 01:38:20,320
star is there that is how one does it

4147
01:38:20,320 --> 01:38:20,330



4148
01:38:20,330 --> 01:38:23,150
notation okay is the cotangent

4149
01:38:23,150 --> 01:38:23,160



4150
01:38:23,160 --> 01:38:26,540
space and now you say yes that is all

4151
01:38:26,540 --> 01:38:26,550



4152
01:38:26,550 --> 01:38:27,680
well and good so we have somehow

4153
01:38:27,680 --> 01:38:27,690



4154
01:38:27,690 --> 01:38:29,180
these directional derivatives those are the

4155
01:38:29,190 --> 01:38:32,600
elements of this T_p M but what would

4156
01:38:32,600 --> 01:38:32,610



4157
01:38:32,610 --> 01:38:35,570
now be a concrete example for

4158
01:38:35,570 --> 01:38:35,580



4159
01:38:35,580 --> 01:38:39,230
an element from T_p M star and the

4160
01:38:39,230 --> 01:38:39,240



4161
01:38:39,240 --> 01:38:40,850
concrete example you also know

4162
01:38:40,850 --> 01:38:40,860



4163
01:38:40,860 --> 01:38:42,290
already since high school nobody has

4164
01:38:42,290 --> 01:38:42,300



4165
01:38:42,300 --> 01:38:45,470
yet told you it goes namely

4166
01:38:45,470 --> 01:38:45,480



4167
01:38:45,480 --> 01:38:49,280
as follows definition we take

4168
01:38:49,280 --> 01:38:49,290



4169
01:38:49,290 --> 01:38:52,070
a point p from a smooth

4170
01:38:52,070 --> 01:38:52,080



4171
01:38:52,080 --> 01:38:57,740
manifold and we define

4172
01:38:57,740 --> 01:38:57,750



4173
01:38:57,750 --> 01:39:00,690
the following object the object is called

4174
01:39:00,690 --> 01:39:00,700



4175
01:39:00,700 --> 01:39:02,600
actually just small d

4176
01:39:02,600 --> 01:39:02,610



4177
01:39:02,610 --> 01:39:05,040
but we want to remember that

4178
01:39:05,040 --> 01:39:05,050



4179
01:39:05,050 --> 01:39:06,780
this is first only at a point p

4180
01:39:06,780 --> 01:39:06,790



4181
01:39:06,790 --> 01:39:08,730
defined so with the we so

4182
01:39:08,730 --> 01:39:08,740



4183
01:39:08,740 --> 01:39:10,890
a small p with with we know it is about

4184
01:39:10,890 --> 01:39:10,900



4185
01:39:10,900 --> 01:39:13,830
here the p on the manifold but

4186
01:39:13,830 --> 01:39:13,840



4187
01:39:13,840 --> 01:39:15,360
actually the small d

4188
01:39:15,360 --> 01:39:15,370



4189
01:39:15,370 --> 01:39:17,730
and what does it do the small d it

4190
01:39:17,730 --> 01:39:17,740



4191
01:39:17,740 --> 01:39:20,790
eats a smooth function and spits

4192
01:39:20,790 --> 01:39:20,800



4193
01:39:20,800 --> 01:39:22,260
out to you one hardly believes it again a

4194
01:39:22,260 --> 01:39:22,270



4195
01:39:22,270 --> 01:39:24,810
real number and it does it in

4196
01:39:24,810 --> 01:39:24,820



4197
01:39:24,820 --> 01:39:30,240
the following way gives then such a df

4198
01:39:30,240 --> 01:39:30,250



4199
01:39:30,250 --> 01:39:33,690
and what is wrong here

4200
01:39:33,690 --> 01:39:33,700



4201
01:39:33,700 --> 01:39:39,090
is all not true at all moment now

4202
01:39:39,090 --> 01:39:39,100



4203
01:39:39,100 --> 01:39:42,120
I have not wasted time here it eats

4204
01:39:42,120 --> 01:39:42,130



4205
01:39:42,130 --> 01:39:45,000
functions that is of course this eats a

4206
01:39:45,000 --> 01:39:45,010



4207
01:39:45,010 --> 01:39:48,590
function but it lands in T star

4208
01:39:48,590 --> 01:39:48,600



4209
01:39:48,600 --> 01:39:52,410
it does namely aha so that means so that

4210
01:39:52,410 --> 01:39:52,420



4211
01:39:52,420 --> 01:39:53,730
here to this one is assigned a real such

4212
01:39:53,730 --> 01:39:53,740



4213
01:39:53,740 --> 01:39:55,710
but this thing must be in this

4214
01:39:55,710 --> 01:39:55,720



4215
01:39:55,720 --> 01:39:57,660
T_p star M

4216
01:39:57,660 --> 01:39:57,670



4217
01:39:57,670 --> 01:40:00,750
but that is a vector space there I know

4218
01:40:00,750 --> 01:40:00,760



4219
01:40:00,760 --> 01:40:02,460
quite certainly how this map

4220
01:40:02,460 --> 01:40:02,470



4221
01:40:02,470 --> 01:40:04,830
looks if I apply it to an

4222
01:40:04,830 --> 01:40:04,840



4223
01:40:04,840 --> 01:40:07,140
arbitrary x in this vector space

4224
01:40:07,140 --> 01:40:07,150



4225
01:40:07,150 --> 01:40:13,530
so for x in T_p M we write this down and

4226
01:40:13,530 --> 01:40:13,540



4227
01:40:13,540 --> 01:40:16,020
now comes the definition and now it is

4228
01:40:16,020 --> 01:40:16,030



4229
01:40:16,030 --> 01:40:18,450
unbelievably simple this is simply the

4230
01:40:18,450 --> 01:40:18,460



4231
01:40:18,460 --> 01:40:22,380
application of x to f as we know well

4232
01:40:22,380 --> 01:40:22,390



4233
01:40:22,390 --> 01:40:24,270
if we have a tangent vector that we

4234
01:40:24,270 --> 01:40:24,280



4235
01:40:24,280 --> 01:40:26,670
apply it to f this directional

4236
01:40:26,670 --> 01:40:26,680



4237
01:40:26,680 --> 01:40:30,090
derivative okay and so this d_p f

4238
01:40:30,090 --> 01:40:30,100



4239
01:40:30,100 --> 01:40:32,790
is defined but you see already this is

4240
01:40:32,790 --> 01:40:32,800



4241
01:40:32,800 --> 01:40:36,090
also linear if you now write x y

4242
01:40:36,090 --> 01:40:36,100



4243
01:40:36,100 --> 01:40:37,440
then it is the sum of

4244
01:40:37,440 --> 01:40:37,450



4245
01:40:37,450 --> 01:40:41,100
both and scales that is you have here

4246
01:40:41,100 --> 01:40:41,110



4247
01:40:41,110 --> 01:40:43,650
actually this df is actually

4248
01:40:43,650 --> 01:40:43,660



4249
01:40:43,660 --> 01:40:46,710
an element in T_p M we write that

4250
01:40:46,710 --> 01:40:46,720



4251
01:40:46,720 --> 01:40:49,350
briefly somewhere

4252
01:41:00,050 --> NaN:NaN:NaN,NaN



4253
01:41:00,060 --> 01:41:09,420
so d_p f is an element from T_p M

4254
01:41:09,420 --> 01:41:09,430



4255
01:41:09,430 --> 01:41:12,060
then namely such an element from T_p M

4256
01:41:12,060 --> 01:41:12,070



4257
01:41:12,070 --> 01:41:14,280
eat without making a real number from it

4258
01:41:14,280 --> 01:41:14,290



4259
01:41:14,290 --> 01:41:19,290
yes exactly so it looks so and now

4260
01:41:19,290 --> 01:41:19,300



4261
01:41:19,300 --> 01:41:25,140
comes the highlight in particular we have

4262
01:41:25,140 --> 01:41:25,150



4263
01:41:25,150 --> 01:41:27,990
a whole if we have a chart let

4264
01:41:27,990 --> 01:41:28,000



4265
01:41:28,000 --> 01:41:34,920
it be a chart then all these

4266
01:41:34,920 --> 01:41:34,930



4267
01:41:34,930 --> 01:41:41,790
functions x1 from to R up to x the dimension

4268
01:41:41,790 --> 01:41:41,800



4269
01:41:41,800 --> 01:41:44,090
from to R those are the coordinate

4270
01:41:44,090 --> 01:41:44,100



4271
01:41:44,100 --> 01:41:46,320
maps they all come from the chart

4272
01:41:46,320 --> 01:41:46,330



4273
01:41:46,330 --> 01:41:48,570
map these are all smooth

4274
01:41:48,570 --> 01:41:48,580



4275
01:41:48,580 --> 01:41:54,960
functions now of course moment now

4276
01:41:54,960 --> 01:41:54,970

4277
01:41:54,960 --> 01:41:57,510
now it is strange was it not so

4278
01:41:57,510 --> 01:41:57,520



4279
01:41:57,520 --> 01:41:59,400
that we can only say about the chart map

4280
01:41:59,400 --> 01:41:59,410



4281
01:41:59,410 --> 01:42:02,400
that it is actually continuous

4282
01:42:02,400 --> 01:42:02,410



4283
01:42:02,410 --> 01:42:04,770
and that we cannot even say

4284
01:42:04,770 --> 01:42:04,780



4285
01:42:04,780 --> 01:42:08,580
that they are smooth yes at first glance

4286
01:42:08,580 --> 01:42:08,590



4287
01:42:08,590 --> 01:42:13,380
yes but we can calculate

4288
01:42:13,380 --> 01:42:13,390



4289
01:42:13,390 --> 01:42:15,090
according to the definition this is a function from

4290
01:42:15,090 --> 01:42:15,100



4291
01:42:15,100 --> 01:42:16,320
the manifold into the real

4292
01:42:16,320 --> 01:42:16,330



4293
01:42:16,330 --> 01:42:16,950
numbers

4294
01:42:16,950 --> 01:42:16,960



4295
01:42:16,960 --> 01:42:18,810
try as a homework to

4296
01:42:18,810 --> 01:42:18,820



4297
01:42:18,820 --> 01:42:20,700
show that they in our sense are C

4298
01:42:20,700 --> 01:42:20,710



4299
01:42:20,710 --> 01:42:24,980
infinity okay but they are

4300
01:42:24,980 --> 01:42:24,990



4301
01:42:24,990 --> 01:42:28,470
and that means one can therefore apply the

4302
01:42:28,470 --> 01:42:28,480



4303
01:42:28,480 --> 01:42:29,910
d to that

4304
01:42:29,910 --> 01:42:29,920



4305
01:42:29,920 --> 01:42:39,770
therefore one can form dx so d_p x1 to d_p

4306
01:42:39,770 --> 01:42:39,780



4307
01:42:39,780 --> 01:42:43,040
xd these things you can all form

4308
01:42:43,040 --> 01:42:43,050



4309
01:42:43,050 --> 01:42:45,330
and from school you know this from

4310
01:42:45,330 --> 01:42:45,340



4311
01:42:45,340 --> 01:42:50,100
the one-dimensional and there you had

4312
01:42:50,100 --> 01:42:50,110



4313
01:42:50,110 --> 01:42:53,700
such dx or the Carmen preferably

4314
01:42:53,700 --> 01:42:53,710



4315
01:42:53,710 --> 01:42:57,690
and with integrals before the dx was always

4316
01:42:57,690 --> 01:42:57,700



4317
01:42:57,700 --> 01:43:01,440
where the integral ends or something

4318
01:43:01,520 --> NaN:NaN:NaN,NaN



4319
01:43:01,530 --> 01:43:04,620
this here is the formal definition

4320
01:43:04,620 --> 01:43:04,630



4321
01:43:04,630 --> 01:43:07,440
of these dx and if you have them in higher

4322
01:43:07,440 --> 01:43:07,450



4323
01:43:07,450 --> 01:43:09,480
dimensions they are also that is

4324
01:43:09,480 --> 01:43:09,490



4325
01:43:09,490 --> 01:43:11,250
also at night the dx dy dz in the integral

4326
01:43:11,250 --> 01:43:11,260



4327
01:43:11,260 --> 01:43:12,070
appear

4328
01:43:12,070 --> 01:43:12,080



4329
01:43:12,080 --> 01:43:15,310
ok and time is up

4330
01:43:15,310 --> 01:43:15,320



4331
01:43:15,320 --> 01:43:17,170
I will make for you on the next exercise

4332
01:43:17,170 --> 01:43:17,180



4333
01:43:17,180 --> 01:43:19,210
sheet beautiful exercises there

4334
01:43:19,210 --> 01:43:19,220



4335
01:43:19,220 --> 01:43:20,740
you will among other things learn that the

4336
01:43:20,740 --> 01:43:20,750



4337
01:43:20,750 --> 01:43:24,040
gradient of a function it is

4338
01:43:24,040 --> 01:43:24,050



4339
01:43:24,050 --> 01:43:26,320
not a vector at all one has in the end

4340
01:43:26,320 --> 01:43:26,330



4341
01:43:26,330 --> 01:43:28,450
a vector the gradient is a covector and

4342
01:43:28,450 --> 01:43:28,460



4343
01:43:28,460 --> 01:43:30,490
not a vector and that one will practice

4344
01:43:30,490 --> 01:43:30,500



4345
01:43:30,500 --> 01:43:33,970
everything there yes more questions

4346
01:43:36,640 --> NaN:NaN:NaN,NaN



4347
01:43:36,650 --> 01:43:38,770
can you stay one more moment please

4348
01:43:38,770 --> 01:43:38,780



4349
01:43:38,780 --> 01:43:45,640
once again yes C1 would also suffice you say

4350
01:43:45,640 --> 01:43:45,650



4351
01:43:45,650 --> 01:43:46,930
that is correct is either that

4352
01:43:46,930 --> 01:43:46,940



4353
01:43:46,940 --> 01:43:49,120
I should have mentioned C1 would

4354
01:43:49,120 --> 01:43:49,130



4355
01:43:49,130 --> 01:43:52,090
suffice but there are theorems that

4356
01:43:52,090 --> 01:43:52,100



4357
01:43:52,100 --> 01:43:54,820
guarantee that C infinity is indeed

4358
01:43:54,820 --> 01:43:54,830



4359
01:43:54,830 --> 01:43:57,370
a stronger requirement but you can

4360
01:43:57,370 --> 01:43:57,380



4361
01:43:57,380 --> 01:43:59,980
from every C1 atlas always also make a C

4362
01:43:59,980 --> 01:43:59,990



4363
01:43:59,990 --> 01:44:01,420
infinity atlas

4364
01:44:01,420 --> 01:44:01,430



4365
01:44:01,430 --> 01:44:03,250
roughly speaking and then one does that

4366
01:44:03,250 --> 01:44:03,260



4367
01:44:03,260 --> 01:44:05,050
as a simplifying assumption then one

4368
01:44:05,050 --> 01:44:05,060



4369
01:44:05,060 --> 01:44:06,790
does not have to worry about how often one

4370
01:44:06,790 --> 01:44:06,800



4371
01:44:06,800 --> 01:44:08,350
could express it sharply that is

4372
01:44:08,350 --> 01:44:08,360



4373
01:44:08,360 --> 01:44:09,240
completely correct

4374
01:44:09,240 --> 01:44:09,250



4375
01:44:09,250 --> 01:44:13,210
okay is Tuesday

4376
01:44:15,150 --> NaN:NaN:NaN,NaN



4377

4378
